  <p>This week on Journal Club session Deepak Panday will talk about a paper &quot;Minkowski Metric, Feature Weighting and Anomalous Cluster Initializing in K-Means Clustering&quot;.</p>

<p>This paper represents another step in overcoming a drawback of
K-Means, its lack of defense against noisy features, using feature
weights in the criterion. The Weighted K-Means method by Huang et al.
(2008, 2004, 2005) [5, 7] is extended to the corresponding Minkowski
metric for measuring distances. Under Minkowski metric the feature
weights become intuitively appealing feature rescaling factors in a
conventional K-Means criterion. To see how this can be used in
addressing another issue of K-Means, the initial setting, a method to
initialize K-Means with anomalous clusters is adapted. The Minkowski
metric based method is experimentally validated on datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and generated sets of Gaussian
clusters, both as they are and with additional uniform random noise
features, and appears to be competitive in comparison with other
K-Means based feature weighting algorithms.</p>

  <p>Studying fabrics at very high magnification helps determine how some face masks filter out particles better than others. And the close-ups reveal an unseen beauty of the mundane objects that have now become an essential part of life around the world.</p>



<p>As scientists continue to show how effective masks can be at slowing the spread of the new coronavirus, particularly when they have a good fit and are worn correctly, some have taken microscopic approaches (SN: 2/12/21).</p>



<p>“Embedded in microscale textures are clues as to why materials have various properties,” says Edward Vicenzi, a microanalysis expert at the Smithsonian’s Museum Conservation Institute in Suitland, Md. “Unraveling that evidence turns out to be a fun job.”</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, Vicenzi spent his days observing meteorites, stones and other museum specimens under the microscope. But in March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, he and colleagues from the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., felt a strong desire to contribute to beating back the virus. So they started studying face-covering materials instead.</p>

				Rayon: Like patterns observed on rigatoni pasta, grooves run along the length of rayon fibers. Unlike cotton flannels, rayon has no apparent weblike structures formed from raised fibers, making it easier for particles to move from one side of the synthetic fabric to the other.				E.P. Vicenzi/Smithsonian’s Museum Conservation Institute and NIST

				Wool flannel: Seen in cross-section, these fibers resemble a hurricane swirl. Wool flannel can also form fiber webs that block particles, but those webs are not as effective as ones in 100-percent cotton, researchers found.				E.P. Vicenzi/Smithsonian’s Museum Conservation Institute and NIST

				N95 mask: In an N95 mask (seen in false color cross-section), a thin outer layer (top) and thick inner layer (bottom) sandwich a filtration layer (purple), which traps the smallest particles. The multilayered assemblage made of plastic is melted and blown into a weblike fabric, which makes N95s filter particles better than cloth masks, even cotton ones.				E.P. Vicenzi/Smithsonian’s Museum Conservation Institute and NIST			

			

</li>	</ol>




<p>Using a scanning electron microscope, Vicenzi and colleagues have examined dozens of materials, including coffee filters, pillowcases, surgical masks and N95 masks. In 2020, the team found that N95 respirator masks are the most effective at providing protection from aerosols like the ones in which SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, travels. And the researchers reported that synthetic fabrics, like chiffon or rayon, don’t trap as many particles as tightly woven cotton flannels.</p>



<p>Microscopic textures can explain each fabric’s ability to filter out aerosols. The random nature of cotton fibers — with its wrinkled texture and complex shapes such as kinks, bends and folds — probably allows cotton to trap more nanoscale particles than other fabrics, Vicenzi says. In contrast, polyester fabrics have highly organized, mostly straight and smooth fibers, which makes them less efficient as face masks.</p>

<p>Cotton flannels also provide additional protection by absorbing moisture from breath, Vicenzi and colleagues report March 8 in ACS Applied Nano Materials.</p>



<p>“Since cotton loves water, it swells up in humid environments, and that makes it harder for particles to make their way through a mask,” says Vicenzi. Polyester and nylon masks, on the other hand, “repel water from your breath, so there’s no added benefit.”</p>



<p>Through his work, Vicenzi has explored the unseen world of face-covering materials. Some textiles remind him of food, such as rayon’s fibers that resemble the texture of rigatoni pasta. Others, like wool, remind him of atmospheric patterns such as the swirl of a hurricane.</p>



<p>Vicenzi plans to keep observing face masks up close. And he hopes his research helps people decide how to best protect themselves and others during the COVID-19 pandemic. “It’s nice to use an effective material for a mask if you can,” he says. “However, wearing any mask compared to none at all makes the biggest difference in slowing the spread of pathogens.”</p>

  <p>A century ago, people needed help to understand science. Much as they do today.</p>



<p>Then as now, it wasn’t always easy to sort the accurate from the erroneous. Mainstream media, then as now, regarded science as secondary to other aspects of their mission. And when science made the news, it was often (then as now) garbled, naïve or dangerously misleading.</p>



<p>E.W. Scripps, a prominent newspaper publisher, and William Emerson Ritter, a biologist, perceived a need. They envisioned a service that would provide reliable news about science to the world, dedicated to truth and clarity. For Scripps and Ritter, science journalism had a noble purpose: “To discover the truth about all sorts of things of human concern, and to report it truthfully and in language comprehensible to those whose welfare is involved.”</p>



<p>And so Science Service was born, 100 years ago — soon to give birth to the magazine now known as Science News.</p>





<p>In its first year of existence, Science Service delivered its weekly dispatches to newspapers in the form of mimeographed packets. By 1922 those packets became available to the public by subscription, giving birth to Science News-Letter, the progenitor of Science News. Then as now, the magazine’s readers feasted on a smorgasbord of delicious tidbits from a menu encompassing all flavors of science — from the atom to outer space, from agriculture to oceanography, from transportation to, of course, food and nutrition.</p>



<p>In those early days, much of the new enterprise’s coverage focused on space, such as the possibility of planets beyond Neptune. Experts shared their views on whether spiral-shaped clouds in deep space were far-off entire galaxies of stars, like the Milky Way, or embryonic solar systems just now forming within the Milky Way. Articles explored the latest speculation about life on Venus (here and here) or on Mars.</p>



<p>Regular coverage was also devoted to new technologies — particularly radio. One Science Service dispatch informed readers on how to make their own home radio set — for $6. And in 1922 Science News-Letter reported on an astounding radio breakthrough: a set that could operate without a battery. You could just plug it in to an electrical outlet.</p>

<p>To celebrate our upcoming 100th anniversary, we&#8217;ve launched a series that highlights some of the biggest advances in science over the last century. Visit our Century of Science site to see the series as it unfolds.</p>

<p>Much of the century’s scientific future was presaged in those early reports. In May 1921, an article on recent subatomic experiments noted the “dream of scientist and novelist alike that man would one day learn how … to utilize the vast stores of energy inside of atoms.” In 1922 Science Service editor Edwin Slosson speculated that the “smallest unit of positive electricity” (the proton) might “be a complex of many positive and negative particles,” a dim but prescient preview of the existence of quarks.</p>



<p>True, some prognostications did not age so well. A 1921 prediction that the United States would be forced to adopt the metric system for commercial transactions is still awaiting fulfillment. A simple, common, international auxiliary language — “confidently predicted” in 1921 to become “a part of every educated person’s equipment” — remains unestablished today. And despite serious considerations of calendar reform by astronomers and church dignitaries reported in May 1922, well over 1,000 of the same old months have since passed without the slightest alteration.</p>



<p>On the other hand, “the favorite fruit of Americans of the generations to follow us will be the avocado,” as predicted in 1921, is possibly arguable, though there was no mention of toast — just the suggestion that “a few crackers and an avocado sprinkled with a little salt make a hearty and well-balanced lunch.”</p>



<p>One happily false prognostication was the repeated forecast of the rise of eugenics as a “scientific” endeavor.</p>



<p>“The organization of an artificial selection is only a question of time. It will be possible to renew as a whole, in a few centuries, all humanity, and to replace the mass by another much superior mass,” a “distinguished authority on anthropo-sociology” declared in a Science Service news item from 1921. Another eugenicist proclaimed that “Eugenic Science” should be applied to “shed the light of reason on the primeval instinct of reproduction,” so that “disgenic marriages” would be banned just as bigamy and incest are.</p>



<p>In the century since, thanks to saner and more sophisticated knowledge of genetics (and more social enlightenment in general), eugenics has been disavowed by science and is now revived in spirit only by the ignorant or malevolent. And during that time, real science has progressed to an elevated degree of sophistication in many other ways, to an extent almost unimaginable to the scientists and journalists of the 1920s.</p>



<blockquote><p>It turns out that the past century’s groundbreaking experimental discoveries, revolutionary theoretical revelations and prescient speculations have not eliminated science’s familiarity with false starts, unfortunate missteps and shortsighted prejudices.</p></blockquote>



<p>When Science Service (now Society for Science) launched its mission, astronomers were unaware of the extent of the universe. No biologist knew what DNA did, or how brain chemistry regulated behavior. Geologists saw that Earth’s continents looked like separated puzzle pieces, but declared that to be a coincidence.</p>



<p>Modern scientists know better. Scientists now understand a lot more about the details of the atom’s interior, the molecules of life, the intricacies of the brain, the innards of the Earth and the expanse of the cosmos.</p>



<p>Yet somehow scientists still pursue the same questions, if now on higher levels of theoretical abstraction rooted in deeper layers of empirical evidence. We know how the molecules of life work, but not always how they react to novel diseases. We know how the brain works, except for those afflicted by dementia or depression (or when consciousness is part of the question). We know a lot about how the Earth works, but not enough to always foresee how it will respond to what humans are doing to it. We think we know a lot about the universe, but we’re not sure if ours is the only one, and we can’t explain how gravity, the dominant force across the cosmos, can coexist with the forces governing atoms.</p>



<p>It turns out that the past century’s groundbreaking experimental discoveries, revolutionary theoretical revelations and prescient speculations have not eliminated science’s familiarity with false starts, unfortunate missteps and shortsighted prejudices. Researchers today have expanded the scope of the reality they can explore, yet still stumble through the remaining uncharted jungles of nature’s facts and laws, seeking further clues to how the world works.</p>



<p>To paraphrase an old philosophy joke, science is more like it is today than it ever has been. In other words, science remains as challenging as ever to human inquiry. And the need to communicate its progress, perceived by Scripps and Ritter a century ago, remains as essential now as then.</p>

  The asteroid impact fundamentally reset the nature of Earth’s tropical rainforests, decreasing diversity at first and making them permanently darker.

  <p>The day before a giant asteroid hit Earth 66 million years ago, a very different kind of rainforest thrived in what is now Colombia. Ferns unfurled and flowering shrubs bathed in the sunlight that streamed down through large gaps in the canopy between towering conifers.</p>



<p>Then the bolide hit and everything changed (SN: 6/1/20). That impact not only set off a massive extinction event that wiped out more than 75 percent of life on Earth, but it also redefined Earth’s tropical rainforests, transforming them from sun-dappled, open-canopied forests into the dark, dense, lush, dripping forests of today’s Amazon, researchers report April 2 in Science.</p>



<p>The researchers analyzed tens of thousands of fossils of pollen, spores and leaves, collected from 39 sites across Colombia, that were dated to between 70 million and 56 million years ago. &nbsp;The team then assessed overall forest plant diversity, dominant species and insect-plant interactions, and tracked how these factors shifted. Plant diversity declined by 45 percent in the immediate aftermath of the asteroid strike, the researchers found, and it took 6 million years before the rich diversity of the tropical rainforest rebounded. Even then, the forests were never the same.</p>



<p>“A single historical accident changed the ecological and evolutionary trajectory of tropical rainforests,” says Carlos Jaramillo, a paleopalynologist — someone who studies ancient pollen — at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama City. “The forests that we have today are really the by-product of what happened 66 million years ago.”</p>





<p>Just before the extinction event, tropical forests were a roughly 50-50 mix of angiosperms, or flowering trees and shrubs, and of other plant species such as conifers and ferns. “The competition for light was not that intense,” Jaramillo says. Afterward, ferns and conifers largely vanished, and angiosperms took over to make up about 90 percent of the plant species in the forest.</p>



<p>The reasons why aren’t wholly clear. The region’s climate at the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million years ago was similar to how it is today: hot and humid. But other factors were likely at work. Huge plant-eating sauropods, the long-necked dinosaurs, would have helped maintain the open gaps, letting light in, Jaramillo says (SN: 11/17/20). Once the asteroid hit, those dinosaurs were out of the picture. Extinction of certain plant families due to the impact also may have played a role, he says.</p>



<p>A third likely factor was a shift in the chemical composition of the forest soil. Frequent rainfall during the warm, wet Cretaceous leached the soils of many nutrients, which would have favored gymnosperms like conifers, says Jaramillo. “The gymnosperms had this amazing ability to grow with very little food, and could outcompete the angiosperms.”</p>



<p>Ashfall fluttering to the ground in the wake of the asteroid impact may have added phosphorus to the soils, effectively fertilizing them, the team suggests. With more food available, angiosperms readily outcompeted the gymnosperms, swiftly growing skyward and blocking out the sunlight.</p>



<p>This thick, closed canopy appeared soon after the impact, but overall forest diversity took much longer to recover, as new species began to evolve to occupy new ecological niches. This was also true of the many insect species that had once feasted on the plants, the researchers found. Leaf fossils bear traces of the different types of interactions between herbivorous insects and plants, from creatures that strip leaves to their skeletons to those that drill careful holes through them.</p>



♦Fossils of leaves (shown) and pollen from across Colombia reveal how the tropical rainforests shifted due to the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous. Before the event, the forests were a sunny, open-canopied mix of conifers, ferns and flowering trees (examples in the bottom half of this image). After the event, the forests were dominated by flowering trees, and developed a thick, heavy, light-blocking canopy (examples in the top half of this image).Carvalho et al/Science 2021



<p>“Generalist” insects and other plant-munching groups that can make do with many different types of plants for food “seemed to squeak through largely unaffected,” says coauthor Conrad Labandeira, a paleoecologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. (SN: 1/25/17). “The specialist interactions that got really creamed were things like leaf miners and piercers and suckers,” which are more dependent on particular plant types, Labandeira says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The recovery path holds a valuable lesson for the long-lasting impact of modern human activities such as deforestation, Jaramillo says (SN: 9/4/20). “Generating new diversity takes geological time,” he says. “It’s not just about planting trees.”</p>



<p>This is the first comprehensive picture of what happened in tropical ecosystems right after the extinction event, says paleoecologist Elena Stiles of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not connected with the study. Most previous work on the chunks of time immediately before and after the extinction event — the very end of the Cretaceous and the start of the Paleogene Period — comes from North America, or from much farther south, such as in Patagonia, Stiles says (SN: 4/2/19). “In the tropics, there is no place where we have the boundary [between periods] preserved, [and] we have the limitation of a very fragmentary fossil record.”</p>



<p>Also striking, Stiles says, is the possibility that this finding may help answer a longstanding question about South America’s astonishing biodiversity. “For a long time, people have wondered where all of this diversity comes from,” she says. Researchers have speculated, for example, that the continent’s climate or its long isolation from other continents may be responsible. “So it’s really interesting that this mass extinction event could have been one of the mechanisms that shaped it to be this unique region,” she says.</p>

  The leading hypothesis is that the coronavirus spread to people from bats via a yet-to-be-identified animal, but no animals have tested positive so far.

  <p>A new World Health Organization report investigating the origins of the coronavirus has raised more questions than answers for how — and where — the virus that exploded into a global pandemic emerged.</p>



<p>The report, released March 30, tallies where the evidence currently points: The virus, called SARS-CoV-2, probably jumped to people from bats through another animal; it likely did not come from a lab. But officials can’t yet prove — or rule out — any scenario. And questions about just how much access to potential evidence an international team of experts had on their 28-day trip to Wuhan, China, in January and February has cast a shadow on the findings.</p>



<p>On that trip, 17 experts with the WHO teamed up with 17 Chinese scientists to assess four potential scenarios for the origins of the coronavirus. The two leading scenarios, the team concluded, are transmission of the virus to people either directly from bats or, more likely, via an intermediate animal like a civet or raccoon dog.</p>



<p>A third possibility is the virus got to people through contaminated frozen food products, which the team considers less likely but says merits further investigation. The last scenario — that the virus began spreading among people following a lab accident — is “extremely unlikely,” the researchers wrote.</p>





Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research



<p>In a joint statement on March 30, 14 countries including the United States expressed concern that the WHO team was delayed and didn’t have access to original data and samples from people and animals. That reaction comes amid reports that the Chinese government had a hand in the mission, controlling the sites the team accessed during the visit and the report’s wording. “Scientific missions like these should be able to do their work under conditions that produce independent and objective recommendations and findings,” the countries wrote in the statement.</p>



<p>Some explanations may be more probable than others, but for now all possibilities remain on the table, says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The report raised questions that require further study, such as additional work to pinpoint the earliest cases of COVID-19, he noted in a March 30 meeting with WHO member states. He also said that when it came to the hypothesis that the virus came from a lab accident, “I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end,” he added. “We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned. Finding the origin of a virus takes time. &#8230; No single research trip can provide all the answers.”</p>



<p>For now though, here are four big takeaways from the 120-page report:</p>



1. Markets are the most probable source of major transmission of the virus.



<p>The focus is back on markets that sell animals.</p>



<p>COVID-19 made its global debut amid a cluster of cases linked to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in late December 2019. Researchers tested hundreds of animals in and around the market for the coronavirus — including animals for sale such as rabbits, hedgehogs, salamanders and birds — but none tested positive. Neither did thousands of domestic or wild animals in and around Wuhan. Additionally, some early COVID-19 cases that experts identified later, after the coronavirus had begun to spread in other countries, were not linked to the market.</p>



<p>Together, the findings hinted that the market may have helped the virus spread among people because of large crowds but that the Huanan Seafood Market was not the original source. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other markets may have also played a role in the virus’ spread, the investigation found. The earliest known case of COVID-19 was in a person who began showing symptoms on December 8, 2019. That person was not associated with the Huanan market but had recently visited another market.</p>



<p>Overall, of 174 people who were sick with COVID-19 in December, more than half had recently gone to a market, where they might have been exposed. An additional 26 percent were exposed to meat and fish or frozen food products.</p>



<p>The failure so far to find an animal that tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 highlights how difficult it is to identify particular species as a potential host, Peter Ben Embarek, lead investigator for the WHO mission and a food safety expert, said in a March 30 news conference. The hunt for where viruses came from takes time — sometimes years (SN: 3/18/21).</p>



<p>Future studies should expand the search for infected animals to wildlife farms that supplied products to the markets linked to COVID-19 cases. The people who work at the farms and those who handled the products should also be tested for antibodies to see if they once had coronavirus infections, the team suggests.</p>



2. The coronavirus probably was not widely circulating before December 2019



<p>There is not yet evidence that the virus was extensively spreading among people before the earliest documented case of COVID-19 in early December, the WHO team found.</p>



<p>Researchers combed through more than 76,000 clinical records from October to November 2019. Within those records, there were 92 possible cases of COVID-19. But 67 of those people did not have signs of an infection based on antibody tests done a year later. And all 92 were ultimately ruled out based on the clinical criteria for COVID-19. The records would not have included mild cases in people who never went to the hospital, however, so there are potential gaps in the evidence.</p>



<p>Additional evidence of isolated cases in countries outside China at the end of 2019 had hinted that the virus may have spread in those places before COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan. But those reports have not yet been confirmed, the team wrote.</p>





See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak





<p>The timing for when the virus began spreading in China is in line with a recent study that analyzed genetic data and ran simulations of the early days of the pandemic to estimate when the virus may have emerged. The spillover from animals to humans may have happened between mid-October and mid-November 2019, Joel Wertheim and colleagues reported March 18 in Science.</p>



<p>After the virus transmitted from animals to humans, cases in people with mild symptoms may have helped the virus fly under the radar until December when some people fell severely ill, says Wertheim, an evolutionary biologist and molecular epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>What’s more, the pandemic itself was far from inevitable, Wertheim says. In the simulations, more than two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from animals to humans went extinct, causing only a few infections in people before dying out. “Even a virus capable of causing a pandemic that brings the world to its knees wasn’t necessarily a foregone conclusion.”</p>



3. The “lab-leak” hypothesis is unlikely, though hard to completely disprove



<p>Based on a visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and interviews with scientists who work there, the report concludes that the virus most likely did not get its start in a lab. Though some experts have called for a full audit of the institute’s labs, the WHO mission was not designed to conduct a forensic investigation, WHO’s Ben Embarek said in the March 30 news conference.</p>



<p>Researchers at the institute considered the lab-leak hypothesis at the beginning of the pandemic and searched the institute’s records but did not find any evidence that anyone there was working with a SARS-CoV-2–like virus, Ben Embarek said. What’s more, antibody tests didn’t turn up any employees with signs of ever having had a coronavirus infection.</p>



<p>The lab leak “is possible, but there’s no evidence to support it,” says Massa Shoura, a biophysicist and genomics expert at Stanford University who was not involved with the report. Other coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS made the jump to humans from animals, so it makes sense that it would be the most likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 as well.</p>



<p>Yet accumulating the data to prove a negative may be extremely difficult. “I don’t think we’ll ever be able to provide enough evidence to convince people who are convinced that it escaped from a lab that it didn’t,” Wertheim says. “Even if you find a virus literally identical to SARS-CoV-2 [in animals] … they could still argue that that virus had previously been found and isolated and brought into a lab and it escaped just the way it was.”</p>





4. Experts are far from knowing the coronavirus’s origins



<p>Overall, the report offers few clear-cut conclusions regarding the start of the pandemic. Instead, it provides context for the possibilities and helps hone in on the studies researchers should tackle next.</p>



<p>Still, more than a year has passed since the virus made its jump to humans. That time lapse may hinder the investigation if SARS-CoV-2 no longer circulating in its reservoir, the animals that originally harbored it.</p>



<p>“We have to be prepared that we may never find the natural reservoir for this virus,” Wertheim says. But sometimes, all it takes is one good sample to give researchers important clues. Perhaps that’s a chance encounter with the right animal during a wildlife survey, or testing people from the right market.</p>



<p>Stepping even further back, researchers need to better understand the diversity of coronaviruses in bats and other wildlife in southeastern Asia, Shoura says. That means compiling a “dictionary” of the viruses found there to help researchers track viral evolutionary history, something the WHO team also recommends.</p>



<p>“We have only scratched the surface of these very complex studies that need to be conducted,” Ben Embarek said.</p>

  <p>Fairy wrasses are swimming jewels, flitting and flouncing about coral reefs. The finger-length fishes’ brash, vibrant courtship displays are meant for mates and rivals, and a new study suggests that the slow waxing and waning of ice sheets and glaciers may be partly responsible for such a variety of performances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new genetic analysis of more than three dozen fairy wrasse species details the roughly 12 million years of evolution that produced their vast assortment of shapes, colors and behaviors. And the timing of these transformations implies that the more than 60 species of fairy wrasses may owe their great diversity to cyclic sea level changes over the last few millions of years, scientists report February 23 in Systematic Biology.</p>



<p>Within the dizzying assembly of colorful reef fishes, fairy wrasses (Cirrhilabrus) can’t help but stand out. They are the most species-rich genus in the second most species-rich fish family in the ocean, says Yi-Kai Tea, an ichthyologist at the University of Sydney.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That is quite a bit of biodiversity,” says Tea, who notes that new fairy wrasse species are identified every year. Despite this taxonomic footprint, Tea says, scientists knew “next to nothing” about the fairy wrasses’ evolutionary history or why there were so many species.</p>





<p>To fill this knowledge gap, Tea and his colleagues turned to the fishes’ genetics, extracting DNA from 39 different fairy wrasse species. Many earlier genetic studies on ocean animals in the region focused on a handful of genes in single species, but Tea and his team used a method that isolated nearly 1,000 genes from many species at once. Comparing DNA across species, the researchers reconstructed an evolutionary tree, showing how the dozens of fairy wrasse species are interrelated. The team also estimated how long ago these species split from one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fairy wrasses diverged from other wrasses about 12 million years ago in the Miocene Epoch, the researchers found. But many of the fairy wrasse species emerged only about 1 million to 3 million years ago, in the Pleistocene and late Pliocene Epochs. Fairy wrasses appear to have first evolved in the Coral Triangle, a region of exceptionally high coral reef biodiversity in the western Pacific Ocean. From there, the fishes exploded into many gaudy forms, spreading as far as the coast of East Africa to French Polynesia, a geographical range of some 17,000 kilometers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tea and his colleagues think the timing of this rapid evolution is tied directly to the geologic history of the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Indo-Australian Archipelago sits at the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins — today, a spattering of islands strung between Asia and Australia. Tea describes this boundary as a “soft barrier,” with the spaces between islands occasionally allowing seafaring species to pass through to the neighboring ocean realm.</p>



<p>But during the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs — when many fairy wrasses diversified — ice ages dramatically changed this seascape. When water became locked up in expansions of ice sheets and glaciers, sea level fell, turning shallow reefs into land bridges. Such changes may have allowed human ancestors to access Indonesia and Australia (SN: 1/9/20), but they also cut off the movement of marine life. This isolation encouraged the evolution of new species on either side of the barrier.</p>

<p>When the glaciers melted again, the waters rose, and the fishes could once again intermix. The rising and falling seas could act like a “species pump,” Tea explains, creating new fairy wrasse species and churning them out into the world every time the barrier dissolved. The team estimates that fairy wrasses infiltrated the Indian Ocean at least five different times this way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings fit into an emerging picture of the region as an engine of biodiversity in tropical seas. Genetic differences between Indian and Pacific Ocean populations have been documented in everything from sea stars to giant clams, notes&nbsp;Paul Barber, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles not involved with this research. Such divergences are signs of temporary isolation on either side of the Indo-Australian Archipelago.</p>



<p>Glacial cycles “get missed sometimes in explanations of the diversification of fishes, particularly in the tropics,” says Lauren Sallan, a paleobiologist at the University of Pennsylvania also not involved with this research. “That aspect just isn’t brought up enough.”</p>



<p>The fairy wrasses’ elaborate mating rituals might also be why there are so many different species, Tea says.</p>



<p>Since the wrasses live in large, mixed-species schools, the males are under extra pressure to not only attract a mate, but to make sure she’s of the correct species. A performance with a recognizable arrangement of colors — and in some cases, fluorescence (SN: 5/29/14) — would come in handy. Going that extra mile to find the right species might make crossbreeding less likely, but also encourages reproductive isolation. Over time, small genetic changes accumulate in each isolated group, so that the two wrasses become fundamentally different species, dissimilar in their DNA, appearance and behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These patterns of fluorescence and colors are very species specific,” says Tea, who explains that there’s “heaps” left to explore about fairy wrasses, especially when it comes to how they choose mates and the evolution of their colors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can dedicate your entire career to this if you wanted to and probably still never learn everything there is to learn with these amazing fishes.”</p>

  <p>By Emma Young</p>



<p>We’re all familiar with the phrase &#8220;healthy body, healthy mind&#8221;. But this doesn’t just refer to physical fitness and muscle strength: for a healthy mind, we need healthy senses, too. Fortunately, there’s now a wealth of evidence that we can train our many senses, to improve not only how we use our bodies, but how we think and behave, as well as how we feel. Trapped as we are in our own &#8220;perceptual bubbles&#8221;, it can be hard to appreciate not only that other people sense things differently — but that so can we, if we only put in a little effort.</p>



<p>But if we’re going to make the most of using and improving our senses to enhance our wellbeing, we have to consider more than sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. Aristotle’s desperately outdated five sense model may still be popular, but it vastly under-estimates our extraordinary human capacity for sensing.</p>







<p>Proprioception</p>



<p>Proprioception — the sensing of the location of our body parts in space  —  has been relatively ignored, but it’s critical for confidence in using our bodies. If you now shut your eyes, and extend a leg, it’s thanks to this sense that you know exactly where your leg is. To go for a run, then, or work out in the gym, and not fall or injure yourself, you need a good sense of proprioception. Our sedentary lifestyles are a threat to this sense (and the Covid-19 lockdowns certainly did not help). But climbing trees, walking along balance beams, navigating obstacles, crossing stepping stones (which you can simulate at home, using small mats placed on the floor) are all proprioceptively demanding, and so train this sense. According to research led by a team at the University at North Florida, these kinds of exercises not only improve physical coordination but also working memory.</p>



<p>Yoko Ichino, the ballet mistress at Northern Ballet, based in Leeds, teaches regular proprioception classes, during which students are required to practise complex moves with their eyes shut. &#8220;We use our eyes too much,&#8221; Ichino says. &#8220;We need to use all our other senses as well but because our eyes are open all the time, we never develop them. So I put that into my own training.&#8221; She recommends (if it is safe) to move around your home with your eyes closed. This will train not only proprioception but another suite of senses:</p>



<p>Vestibular senses</p>



<p>Our vestibular system allows us to sense the direction of gravity (and so which way is up), as well as horizontal and vertical movement (as in a car or a lift) and in three dimensions (as on a rollercoaster). Research shows that a healthy vestibular system is important not only for balance but for our sense of being grounded inside a physical body; in fact, people with vestibular problems are more likely to report out-of-body experiences. They’re also more likely to get lost, because a healthy vestibular system is important for a good sense of direction.</p>



<p>For all of us, though, the older we get, the duller all our vestibular responses become. (This becomes noticeable at a population level from the not very grand old age of 40). Specific vestibular rehab training exercises have been developed for people diagnosed with definite vestibular problems. But the rest of us will benefit from dynamic movements that require moving the head, like those involved in climbing a tree or practising tai chi, as well as anything that challenges our balance.</p>



<p>Light-detection</p>



<p>We know that our eyes are not just for seeing. When melanopsin-expressing cells in the retina are exposed to light, they send signals to the master body-clock, in the brain’s hypothalamus (without causing us to see a thing). Certain variations in the gene for this protein have been linked to an increased risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder, and stimulating these receptors in the morning with suitable levels of light helps to ward off low mood. To improve psychological wellbeing, you don’t need to train these receptors to work better, but you do need to help them to work for you by getting outdoors in the morning and avoiding bright light in the evening.</p>



<p>Smell</p>



<p>Smell is not hugely regarded, or developed, in many people in Western cultures. But research with hunter-gatherer groups, such as the Jahai, who live in the tropical rainforest in Malaysia, shows that we have the biological capacity to smell extraordinarily well. Asifa Majid, now at the University of York, and colleagues, found, for example, that the Jahai took on average only two seconds to precisely describe an odour, while Dutch-speakers took an average of 13 seconds to arrive at a much poorer description (describing the scent of a lemon simply as &#8220;lemony&#8221;, say, rather than using more abstract descriptions).</p>



<p>To develop your sense of smell, Majid and others advocate consciously smelling different things, often. Professional perfumer Nadjib Achaibou, who is based in London, tells me that his sensitive nose is absolutely trained, not born. The best way to enhance your sense of smell is to use it, and explore it, he argues: “You might say, ‘Oh, I like pepper.’ Why? Why do I like it? What is it adding to your dish? That’s the first step to enhance your sense of smell. If you see a rose, stop and smell it. If you have a friend wearing perfume, smell the perfume and describe it. When you buy a shower gel, a toilet detergent or a perfume, ask questions. Read the marketing materials, but also trust yourself. You might think, yes they say there is rose in that but what I can smell is lemon. But what kind of lemon?”</p>



<p>Put in the effort to enhance your sense of smell, and you should enjoy all kinds of other benefits. Research shows that a fishy smell improves our critical thinking, for example, while a 2018 study in Germany found that people who are more sensitive to smells enjoyed sex more, and women with a better sense of smell reported more orgasms. &#8220;The perception of body odours such as vaginal fluids, sperm and sweat seems to enrich the sexual experience,&#8221; by increasing sexual arousal, they wrote.</p>



<p>Temperature</p>



<p>We have receptors in our skin that register temperatures within specific ranges. Stimulation of our &#8220;warmth-sensors&#8221;, in particular, has been linked to feeling less lonely, and also &#8220;warmer&#8221; towards other people. Some of the most-publicised results in this field have failed to replicate, leading critics to question them. However, a 2019 study in Social Psychology suggested that results might have been mixed because researchers weren’t taking into account the ambient temperature outside, or inside the lab. When they did this in their research — which involved strapping heated backwraps to participants and asking them about their social plans — the team found support for the idea that feeling cold physically is associated with feeling &#8220;colder&#8221; socially, driving a desire for more contact with other people. Providing heat (via the backwrap, in this case) could eliminate this effect. </p>



<p>Inner sensing (interoception)</p>



<p>About 10% of us are really good at sensing our own heartbeat without feeling for a pulse, 5-10% of us are terrible at it, and the rest fall in between. Research shows that people who are better at so-called &#8220;cardiac interoception&#8221; experience emotions more intensely, enjoy more nuanced emotions, and are better at recognising other people’s emotions, which is a critical first step in empathy. In contrast, people who don’t experience emotions in the typical way (a condition called &#8220;alexithymia&#8221;, which is thought to affect up to 10% of people, to some extent) suffer from impairments in inner sensing. Could training inner sensing help, then, to improve our emotional wellbeing? It’s still early days for this research, but work led by Sarah Garfinkel, now at University College London, suggests that it can. This is a training technique that you could try at home:</p>



<ol><li>Sit somewhere quiet and set a timer (on your phone or home digital assistant, perhaps) for one minute, but don’t start it yet.</li><li>Now start the timer, and try to count your heart beats.</li><li>Do this again, but feel for your pulse this time, to take an accurate measure (this is the feedback that should help your interoceptive awareness to improve).</li><li>Repeat all the steps.</li></ol>



<p>If you can’t sense your heart beating, try exercising first, because this makes it easier.</p>

And despair. A study on probabilistic decision-making under uncertain and volatile conditions came to the conclusion that people with anxiety and depression will benefit from focusing on past successes, instead of failures. Which kinda goes without saying. The paper in eLife was far more measured and sophisticated, but the press release said:</p><blockquote>The more chaotic things get, the harder it is for people with clinical anxiety and/or depression to make sound decisions and to learn from their mistakes. On a positive note, overly anxious and depressed people’s judgment can improve if they focus on what they get right, instead of what they get wrong...<br><br>...researchers tested the probabilistic decision-making skills of more than 300 adults, including people with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

Further advice:</p><blockquote>“When everything keeps changing rapidly, and you get a bad outcome from a decision you make, you might fixate on what you did wrong, which is often the case with clinically anxious or depressed people...” <br><br>...individualized treatments, such as cognitive behavior therapy, could improve both decision-making skills and confidence by focusing on past successes, instead of failures...</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The final statement on individualized CBT could very well be true, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of the study (Gagne et al., 2021), wherein participants chose between two shapes associated with differential probabilities of receiving electric shock (Exp. 1), or financial gain or loss (Exp. 2).<br>&nbsp;</p><p></p>♦<br><p></p>With that out of the way, I will say the experiments and the computational modeling approach are impressive. The theme is probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty, with the added bonus of volatility in the underlying causal structure (e.g., the square is suddenly associated a higher probability of shocks). People with anxiety disorders and depression are generally intolerant of  uncertainty. Learning the stimulus-outcome contingencies and then  rapidly adapting to change was predictably impaired. <br><p></p><p></p><p>Does this general finding differ for learning under reward vs. punishment? For anxiety vs. depression? In the past, depression was associated with altered learning under reward, while  anxiety was associated with altered learning under punishment (including in the authors' own work). For reasons that were not entirely clear to me, the authors chose to classify symptoms using a bifactor model designed to capture “internalizing psychopathology” common to both anxiety and depression vs. symptoms that are unique to each disorder [ but see Fried (2021) ]1 </p><p>Overall, high scores on the common internalizing factor were associated with impaired adjustments to learning rate during the volatile condition, and this held whether the outcomes were shocks, financial gains, or financial losses. Meanwhile, high scores on anxiety-unique or depression-unique symptoms did not show this relationship. This was determined by computational modeling of task performance, using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to identify the model that best described the participants' behavior:<br></p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>We fitted participants’ choice behavior using alternate versions of simple reinforcement learning models. We focused on models that were parameterized in a sufficiently flexible manner to capture differences in behavior between experimental conditions (block type: volatile versus stable; task version: reward gain versus aversive) and differences in learning from better or worse than expected outcomes. We used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate distributions over model parameters at an individual- and population-level with the latter capturing variation as a function of general, anxiety-specific, and depression-specific internalizing symptoms.&nbsp;</blockquote><p></p><p><br></p><p>We've been living in a very uncertain world for more than a year now, often in a state of loneliness and isolation. Some of us have experienced loss after loss, deteriorating mental health, lack of motivation, lack of purpose, and difficulty making decisions.

  <p>Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine proved highly effective in adults. Now it appears to work well in younger people too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a Phase III clinical trial of 12- to 15-year-olds, participants who received the shot developed higher levels of antibodies to the coronavirus on average compared with vaccinated 16- to 25-year-olds from a previous trial (SN: 11/18/20). And those antibody levels make for a vaccine with high efficacy. None of the 1,131 vaccinated teens developed COVID-19 symptoms. There were 18 cases among the 1,129 youths in the unvaccinated group, Pfizer reported in a March 31 news release</p>

<p>That 100 percent efficacy, based on a small number of cases overall, could decrease a bit as the trial continues because additional cases might pop up. Still, the results point to a vaccine that works well in adolescents.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The news is “astounding and very exciting,” Colleen Kelley, an infectious diseases physician at Emory University in Atlanta who helped lead a trial of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, said in a call with reporters. Though Pfizer has not yet released all the data from the trial, protecting adolescents “will go a long way to end the pandemic,” she said. That’s because kids younger than 12 appear to be less likely than older kids to get infected with the coronavirus and pass it on to others. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shot’s side effects in the 12- to 15-year-olds were similar to those seen in the 16- to 25-year-old age group, the company said. The most common side effect in the older participants was pain at the injection site, followed by fatigue and headache.</p>

<p>Pfizer plans to submit the data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as the European Medicines Agency, as soon as possible to ask that its emergency use authorizations be altered so that vaccinations can be expanded to those 12 and older.</p>



<p>Last week, Pfizer began testing its vaccine in children ages 6 months to 11 years. Moderna started a trial of its vaccine in similarly aged children last week, and AstraZeneca launched a trial of its vaccine in 6- to 17-year-olds in February.</p>



<p>Infectious disease experts are optimistic that the vaccines could be ready for kids as early as the summer (SN: 2/25/21).</p>

  <p>Seventeen tiny particles recovered from a flat-topped mountain in eastern Antarctica suggest that a space rock shattered low in the atmosphere over the ice-smothered continent about 430,000 years ago.</p>



<p>The nickel- and magnesium-rich bits were sifted from more than 6 kilograms of loose sediments collected atop the 2,500-meter-tall summit of Walnumfjellet, says Matthias van Ginneken, a cosmochemist at the University of Kent in England. Their exotic chemistry doesn’t match Earth rocks, but it does match the proportions of elements seen in a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite, van Ginneken and his colleagues report March 31 in Science Advances.</p>



<p>Most of the particles range in size from 0.1 to 0.3 millimeters across, and more than half consist of spherules that are fused together into odd-shaped globs. The elemental mix in the spherules closely matches that of particles found at two other far-flung sites in Antarctica— one more than 2,750 kilometers away — which suggests that all of the materials originated in the same event. Because the other particles were found in ice cores and dated to about 430,000 years ago, the team presumes that the newly found particles from Walnumfjellet fell then too. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The meteor that broke up over Antarctica was between 100 to 150 meters across, the team’s simulations suggest, and probably burst at low altitude. Blast waves may have pummeled a 100,000-square-kilometer area of the ice sheet, the team estimates. The explosion left no crater, but peak temperatures where the plume of hot gases reached Earth’s surface would have hit 5,000° Celsius and may have melted up to a few centimeters of ice. A similar airburst over a densely populated area today would result in millions of casualties and severely damage an area hundreds of kilometers across (SN: 5/2/17).</p>

  The “xenobots” can swim, navigate tubes, move particles into piles and even heal themselves after injury, a new study reports.

  <p>Using blobs of skin cells from frog embryos, scientists have grown creatures unlike anything else on Earth, a new study reports. These microscopic “living machines” can swim, sweep up debris and heal themselves after a gash.</p>



<p>Scientists often strive to understand the world as it exists, says Jacob Foster, a collective intelligence researcher at UCLA not involved with this research. But the new study, published March 31 in Science Robotics, is part of a “liberating moment in the history of science,” Foster says. “A reorientation towards what is possible.”</p>



<p>In a way, the bots were self-made. Scientists removed small clumps of skin stem cells from frog embryos, to see what these cells would do on their own. Separated from their usual spots in a growing frog embryo, the cells organized themselves into balls and grew. About three days later, the clusters, called xenobots, began to swim.</p>



<p>Normally, hairlike structures called cilia on frog skin repel pathogens and spread mucus around. But on the xenobots, cilia allowed them to motor around. That surprising development “is a great example of life reusing what’s at hand,” says study coauthor Michael Levin, a biologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.</p>



♦A swarm of xenobots (bright spots) swims around and pushes small particles.Douglas Blackiston



<p>And that process happens fast. “This isn’t some sort of effect where evolution has found a new use over hundreds of thousands of years,” Levin says. “This happens in front of your eyes within two or three days.”</p>



<p>Xenobots have no nerve cells and no brains. Yet xenobots — each about half a millimeter wide — can swim through very thin tubes and traverse curvy mazes. When put into an arena littered with small particles of iron oxide, the xenobots can sweep the debris into piles. Xenobots can even heal themselves; after being cut, the bots zipper themselves back into their spherical shapes.<br><br>Scientists are still working out the basics of xenobot life. The creatures can live for about 10 days without food. When fed sugar, xenobots can live longer (though they don’t keep growing). “We’ve grown them for over four months in the lab,” says study coauthor Doug Blackiston, also at Tufts. “They do really interesting things if you grow them,” including forming strange balloon-like shapes.</p>



♦This xenobot is about 500 micrometers across and is made of frog cells, even though it looks and acts nothing like an actual frog.Douglas Blackiston



<p>It’s not yet clear what sorts of jobs these xenobots might do, if any. Cleaning up waterways, arteries or other small spaces comes to mind, the researchers say. More broadly, these organisms may hold lessons about how bodies are built, Levin says.</p>



<p>With the advent of new organisms comes ethical issues, cautions Kobi Leins, a digital ethics researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia. “Scientists like to make things, and don’t necessarily think about what the repercussions are,” she says. More conversations about unintended consequences are needed, she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Levin agrees. The small xenobots are fascinating in their own rights, he says, but they raise bigger questions, and bigger possibilities. “It’s finding a whole galaxy of weird new things.”</p>

  Invasive species have cost the global economy at least $1 trillion since 1970 and $162.7 billion in 2017 alone. The annual cost is increasing.

  <p>Invasive species can wreak havoc on local ecosystems. Cleaning up that biological wreckage comes at a big price.</p>



<p>These invaders, often thrust into new environments unintentionally (or intentionally, to combat pests) by humans, can transmit new diseases, devastate crops and eat away at crucial infrastructure. From 1970 to 2017, such invasions cost the global economy at least $1.28 trillion in damages and in efforts to control them, researchers report March 31 in Nature. As the globe becomes increasingly interconnected and invasive species take over new habitats, that cost grows.</p>



<p>“For decades, researchers have been evaluating the significant impacts of invasive species, but the problem isn’t well known by the public and policy makers,” says Boris Leroy, a biogeographer at the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris. “By estimating the global cost, we hoped to raise awareness of the issue and identify the most costly species.”</p>



<p>Leroy and his colleagues screened over 19,000 published papers, ultimately analyzing nearly 1,900 that detailed the costs of various invasions at particular times. The team then constructed a statistical model that estimated yearly costs, adjusting for factors like inflation, different currencies and timescales. Between 1970 and 2017, annual costs roughly doubled every six years, reaching a yearly bill of $162.7 billion in 2017.</p>






Costly critters



<p>Some invasive species cause more economic damage than others. Researchers analyzed published data from the past few decades to rank the 10 costliest species or species groups from 1970 to 2017. Total costs are broken down into damages, costs of managing invasive species, and costs that don’t fit neatly into one of those categories. Most of the top offenders are insects — mosquitoes head the list while screw-worm flies round it out — but cats, rats and some snakes are big troublemakers, too.&nbsp; Gaps in data — on plants, for instance — likely skew these rankings.</p>

<p>Intensified global trade over that period gave invaders more opportunities to hitch rides on cargo ships or airplanes, the researchers say. And deforestation and agricultural expansion probably sped their spread by allowing easier access to pristine areas.</p>



<p>On the whole, cleaning up the damage caused by invasive species cost $892 billion, about 13 times higher than the $66 billion spent managing invasions, the researchers found.</p>



<p>“This is a really ambitious effort,” says Helen Roy, an ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, England. “There are major gaps in the data, which the authors are extremely transparent about,” she says. The analysis was heavily weighted towards North America, Europe and parts of Asia and Oceania. Agricultural pests, like insects, tended to be overrepresented in published literature compared with invasive plants.</p>



<p>“Still, getting a global look is very important,” Roy says. While this number is almost certainly an underestimate, she says, the study “shows us that this is a massive problem that’s getting worse.” Investing more in cargo inspections and other biosecurity measures or monitoring could help minimize these costs with comparatively small spending increases. “It’s much cheaper than waiting for the species to establish and spread widely before responding,” she says.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at the top five costliest invasive species.</p>



1. Aedes mosquitoes (A. albopictus and A. aegypti): about $149 billion 



<p>The Asian tiger mosquito (A. albopictus) arrived in the United States in the mid-1980s, by way of hitchhiking in used tires shipped from its native Asia. First detected in Houston, it rapidly spread to 40 states. It’s also invaded parts of Europe, South America, Africa and Australia.&nbsp;A. aegypti, or the yellow fever mosquito, is native to sub-Saharan Africa and spread around the world by similar methods.</p>



<p>Together, these two mosquitoes cause significant damage to public health by transmitting a range of diseases like Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever and dengue, which accounts for the bulk of their cost. As the mosquitoes spread, the toll of these diseases grows (SN: 11/20/19).</p>



2. Rattus (rats): about $67 billion



<p>These rodents’ worldwide occupation stems from about 3,000 years of hitchhiking on human boats. Once they arrive in a new location, rats often outcompete other small mammals, but can also harm birds and aquatic species. On islands around the world, rats have driven many species to extinction. For example, the Pacific rat, native to mainland southeast Asia, has snuffed out at least 1,000 species of island birds. Rats’ high cost stems from these biodiversity losses, but the rodents also can damage crops, destroy property and transmit disease (like the bubonic plague). </p>





3. Felis catus (cats): about $52 billion



<p>Native to Europe and the Middle East, our feline friends have established themselves on all nonfrozen continents. Cats are excellent predators, and can make a quick meal from a variety of prey, from insects to birds. By some estimates, cats kill a billion birds each year in the United States alone (SN: 1/29/13). The bulk of the economic damage inflicted by cats cataloged in Leroy’s analysis comes from their impact on native biodiversity and resulting losses in spending on birdwatching and hunting birds like ducks, pheasants and grouse.&nbsp;</p>



4. Coptotermes formosanus (termites): about $19 billion



<p>These subterranean termites native to East Asia have spread around the globe via trade. Termites can thrive wherever there is cellulose (like wood) and moisture, which has helped them quickly establish colonies upon being introduced to a new region. Their appetite for wood can wreak havoc on all kinds of structures, from homes to bridges. While they can also damage crops and tree farms, their high cost in this analysis boils down to their impact on infrastructure.</p>



5. Solenopsis invicta (fire ants): about $17 billion



<p>Fire ants usually become the dominant ant species when introduced to a new region, due to their aggressive foraging tactics, which include potent stings and bites. Native to South America, these ants arrived in the United States in the 1930s by boat, most likely carried in soil from the region. They’ve also spread to Australia, New Zealand, China and around the Caribbean. Fire ant colonies have wide-ranging impacts; they can feed on a variety of seedlings, from citrus to soybeans, reduce the size of grazing lands for livestock and bite and sting farm animals and humans.</p>

  <p>Africa’s southern Kalahari Desert is not typically regarded as a hotbed of Stone Age innovations. And yet human culture blossomed there around 105,000 years ago, back when it was green, researchers say.</p>



<p>Calcite crystals and other finds at a South African rock-shelter more than 600 kilometers from the nearest shoreline reflect cultural behaviors on a par with those previously reported for ancient humans living on or near South Africa’s coast, researchers report March 31 in Nature. Those coastal sites date to between roughly 125,000 and 70,000 years ago, including one where locals used tools to make paint out of pigment around 100,000 years ago (SN: 10/13/11).</p>



<p>Given the scarcity of human sites from that time period, it’s hard to know whether cultural innovations emerged independently in groups spread across southern Africa or originated in one particular region before being adopted elsewhere. But the new discoveries fit a scenario in which “the emergence of Homo sapiens involved the interaction of many different populations across Africa,” says archaeologist Jayne Wilkins of Griffith University in Nathan, Australia. “And that included the Kalahari Desert.”</p>



<p>Excavations at Ga-Mohana Hill North Rockshelter, or GHN, uncovered an ancient sediment layer containing 42 burned ostrich eggshell fragments and 22 palm-sized or smaller calcite crystals, Wilkins and her colleagues report.</p>

♦Stone Age humans based in a “green” Kalahari collected calcite crystals that they may have viewed as having ritual or symbolic meanings.J. Wilkins



<p>Like some African hunter-gatherer groups today, ancient people at GHN may have cut holes out of ostrich eggshells to create water containers, the researchers say. Geologic studies indicated that enough rain once fell over the southern Kalahari Desert to have produced year-round water sources for ancient GHN people.</p>



<p>Many eggshell pieces showed discoloration from burning. It’s not clear how that burning occurred. Eggshells lay among numerous animal bones, some of which displayed possible butchery marks and signs of burning.</p>





<p>The calcite crystals were probably collected from local rock sources, one of which lies about 2.5 kilometers from the rock-shelter, the scientists suspect. Excavated calcite crystals hadn’t been modified in any way and had no apparent practical use, raising the possibility that these items held ritual or symbolic significance, Wilkins suspects.</p>



<p>Crystals have been linked to spiritual beliefs and rituals in many parts of the world. Until now, the oldest set of crystals dated to around 80,000 years ago at another South African rock-shelter located about 130 kilometers from the coast, Wilkins says.</p>



<p>Other GHN finds included hundreds of stone tools, prepared rock chunks from which tools were struck and a piece of red pigment bearing scrape marks.</p>



♦A stone tool unearthed at an inland African site belongs to a set of artifacts pointing to ancient cultural advances among humans who lived far from resource-rich coastlines.J. Wilkins



<p>Ancient cultural evolution in many parts of Africa remains a mystery, writes archaeologist Pamela Willoughby of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, in a commentary published with the new study. Calcite crystals found at GHN perhaps represent “an early example of ritualistic symbolic behavior,” according to Willoughby.</p>



<p>Any ritualistic use of the GHN crystals is difficult to demonstrate, contends archaeologist Manuel Will of the University of Tübingen in Germany. Ostrich eggshell pieces found at the Kalahari site could have been discarded after a meal, he says.</p>



<p>Still, the new study adds to growing skepticism about claims that human cultural advances started along African coasts, Will says (SN: 7/29/11). It’s possible, though, that bountiful habitats along southern Africa’s coastline fostered an especially broad range of cultural innovations, he suggests. Coastal sites have yielded items that weren’t found inland at GHN, including beads, bone tools and ostrich eggshells bearing engraved designs.</p>

  <p>By Emma Young</p>



<p>When an organisation appoints a new male CEO, the announcement will typically highlight his past achievements and the competencies that make him ideal for the job. What if the new CEO is a woman? The widely expected, gender-neutral thing to do is, of course, to make precisely the same type of announcement. However, according to the team behind a new paper in the Journal of Applied Psychology, this can make work life more difficult for her, and shorten the time that she spends in that role. Priyanka Dwiwedi at Texas A&amp;M University and her colleagues base this striking conclusion on an extensive analysis of data on women who have been appointed to top positions in the US, as well as in-depth interviews with female executives.</p>







<p>Why might an announcement that focuses on the winning candidate’s past successes and competences affect a female vs a male leader differently? Perhaps, the team theorised, it might showcase “that the new female leader does not adhere to prescriptive norms about how women ‘should be’. Such violations could elicit social disapproval, backlash and evaluation penalties for women.” In other words, new female leaders who are praised for their competence, confidence and ambition (stereotypically &#8220;male&#8221;-type leadership traits) may then experience &#8220;stereotype threat&#8221; — and feel judged for not conforming to the stereotypically female profile of being nurturing, socially sensitive and group-focused. The psychological burden of this could then make it harder for the woman to remain in her job. Lab-based work has supported these ideas, and there has been some anecdotal evidence in its favour, too. But this is the first attempt at major, real-world investigation.</p>



<p>To start with, the team considered 91 female CEO successions among companies included in major US stock market indices between 1995 and 2012. When a host of other factors that could plausibly have influenced any CEO’s longevity were taken into account, the researchers noted a link between endorsements that focused on success and competence and a shorter time as CEO. (These endorsements came from the companies’ own websites, press releases and annual reports, for example.) Two factors did emerge as being linked to a longer time in the job despite success-focused endorsements, however: the female CEO being an internal rather than an external appointment, and the presence of a relatively high number of female executives in the company. Analysis of a matched sample of male CEOs did not reveal a link between endorsement content and time in the role.</p>



<p>The team then ran semi-structured interviews with 31 female executives (not all CEOs, though all in senior management positions), each with an average of 25 years’ experience at a variety of US companies. The findings from this qualitative portion of the study supported the team’s idea that such women are subject to stereotype threat. They found that “female executives were chronically aware of gender stereotyping and continued biases in the male-dominated context of upper echelons both during their transition into, and throughout their time in, their executive roles.” These women also reported all kinds of negative personal responses, including anxiety about being perceived as incompetent, or having insufficient legitimacy as a leader, as well as feeling exhausted with dealing with the stereotypes. For example, one commented: “When a woman is demanding, they think she’s a bitch… But if a man is demanding, they see him as tough and good.” Another talked about how, as she moved up the ranks, she felt much more hostility and exclusion — so much so, that she eventually quit her job.</p>



<p>The interview-based segment of the study supports the idea that women in top leadership roles suffer from unhelpful stereotypes about women. When it comes to the team’s main conclusion, however — that the content of the endorsement of a new female CEO can affect her longevity in the job — it’s important to note that the link is correlational. (Though the team’s failure to find such an association for the male CEOs is certainly worth stressing.) Though the researchers did control for a lot of other potential influences on their results, this study could not definitively demonstrate that the content of the appointee endorsement in and of itself causes greater or lesser stereotype-related pressures on a female CEO. But if their suggestion that it does is correct, what are the practical lessons?</p>



<p>It does pose a dilemma for companies, the researchers accept. “While they would do well to support their new female leaders in as many ways as they can, they also need to constantly recognise that any such support could backfire because of implicit gender biases and stereotyping”. The team did find that the presence of more female executives mitigated this, though. So: “Perhaps the only long-term solution to this dilemma is for organisations to obtain a critical mass of female leaders in order to buffer them against potentially negative stakeholder perceptions.” They add that though this study focused on women, it’s likely that CEOs from other minorities in the executive level in businesses will experience something very similar. The finding also contributes to the growing body of work finding that well-intentioned attempts to counteract gender stereotypes can backfire.</p>

  If dark matter WIMPs are mythical, they join the ancient idea that the planets moved in circles.

  <p>Second of two parts</p>



<p>Physicists have a lot in common with Ponce de León and U2’s Bono. After decades of searching, they aren’t getting any younger. And they still haven’t found what they’re looking for.</p>



<p>In this case, the object of the physicists’ quest is SUSY. SUSY is not a real person or even a fountain relevant to aging in any way. It’s a mathematical framework based on principles of symmetry that could help physicists better explain the mysteries of the universe. Many experts believe that particles predicted by SUSY are the weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, that supposedly make up the invisible “dark matter” lurking throughout the cosmos.</p>



<p>So far, though, SUSY has been something of a disappointment. Despite multiple heroic searches, SUSY has remained concealed from view. Maybe it is a mathematical mirage.</p>





<p>If SUSY does turn out to be a myth, it won’t be the first time that symmetry has led science on a wild WIMP chase. Reasoning from the symmetry of circular motion originally suggested the existence of a new form of matter out in space more than two millennia ago. Devotion to that symmetry blinded science to the true nature of the solar system and planetary motion for the next 19 centuries.</p>



<p>You can blame Plato and Aristotle. In their day, ordinary matter supposedly consisted of four elements: earth, air, fire and water. Aristotle built an elaborate theory of motion based on those elements. He insisted that they naturally moved in straight lines; earth and water moving straight down (toward the center of the world), air and fire moving straight up. In the heavens, though, Aristotle noticed that motion appeared to be circular, as the stars rotated around the nighttime sky. “Our eyes tell us that the heavens revolve in a circle,” he wrote in On the Heavens. Since the known four elements all moved in a straight line, Aristotle deduced that the heavens must consist of a fifth element, called aether — absent on Earth but predominant in space.</p>





<p>Plato, on theoretical rather than observational grounds, had already insisted that circularity’s symmetry signified perfection, and therefore circular motion should be required in the heavens. And so for centuries, the assumption that celestial motion must be circular held a stranglehold on natural philosophers attempting to understand of the universe. As late as the 16th century, Copernicus was willing to depose Aristotle’s Earth from the middle of everything but still believed that the Earth and other planets revolved around the sun with a combination of circular motions. Another half century passed before Kepler established that planetary orbits are elliptical, not circular.</p>



<p>Aristotle’s belief in an exotic form of matter in space is not so different from the picture scientists paint of the heavens today, albeit in a rather more rigorous and sophisticated theoretical way. Dark matter predominates in space, astronomers believe; it is inferred to exist from gravitational effects altering the motions of stars and galaxies. And physicists have determined that the dark matter cannot (for various noncircular reasons) be made of the same ordinary matter found on Earth.</p>



<p>SUSY particles have long been one of the most popular proposals for the identity of this cosmic dark matter, based on more complicated notions of symmetry than those available to Plato and Aristotle. And since the onset of the 20th century, symmetry math has generated an astounding string of scientific successes. From Einstein’s relativity to the theory of elementary particles and forces, symmetry considerations now form the core of science’s understanding of nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These mathematical forms of symmetry are more elaborate examples of symmetry as commonly understood: a change that leaves things looking like they did before. A perfectly symmetric face looks the same when a mirror swaps left with right. A perfect sphere’s appearance is not altered when you rotate it to see the other side. Rotate a snowflake by any multiple of 60 degrees and you see the same snowflake.</p>



<p>In a similar way, more sophisticated mathematical frameworks, known as symmetry groups, describe aspects of the physical world, such as time and space or the families of subatomic particles that make up matter or transmit forces. Symmetries in the equations of such math can even predict previously unknown phenomena. Symmetry in the equations describing subatomic particles, for instance, revealed that for each particle nature allowed an antimatter particle, with opposite electric charge.</p>



<p>In fact, all the known ordinary matter and force particles fit neatly into the mathematical patterns described by symmetry groups. But none of those particles can explain the dark matter.</p>



<p>SUSY particles as a dark matter possibility emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, when theorists proposed an even more advanced symmetry system. That math, called supersymmetry (hence SUSY), suggested the existence of a “super” partner particle for each known particle: a force-particle partner for every matter particle, and a matter-particle partner for every force particle. It was an elegant concept mathematically, and it solved (or at least ameliorated) some other vexing theoretical problems. Plus, of the super partner particles it predicted, the lightest one (whichever one that was) seemed likely to be a perfect dark matter WIMP.</p>



<p>Alas, efforts to detect WIMPs (which should be hitting the Earth all the time) have almost all failed to find any. One experiment that did claim a WIMP detection seems to be on shaky ground — a new experiment, using the same method and materials, reports no such WIMP evidence. And attempts to produce SUSY particles in the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, have also come up empty.</p>



<p>Some physicists have therefore given up on SUSY. And perhaps supersymmetry has been as misleading as the Greek infatuation with circular motion. But the truth is that SUSY is not a theory that can be slain by a single experiment. It is a more nebulous mathematical notion, a framework within which many specific theories can be constructed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t really kill SUSY because it’s not a thing,” physicist Patrick Stengel of the International Higher School of Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, said at a conference in Washington, D.C., in 2019. “It’s not an idea that you can kill. It’s basically just a framework for a bunch of ideas.”</p>



<p>At the same conference, University of Texas at Austin physicist Katherine Freese pointed out that there was never any guarantee that the Large Hadron Collider would discover SUSY. “Even before the LHC got built, there were a lot of people who said, well, it might not go to a high enough energy,” she said.</p>



<p>So SUSY may yet turn out to be an example of symmetry that leads physics to success. But just in case, physicists have pursued other dark matter possibilities. One old suggestion that has recently received renewed interest is a lightweight hypothetical particle called an axion (SN: 3/24/20).</p>



<p>Of course, if axions do exist, symmetry fans could still rejoice — the motivation for proposing the axion to begin with was resolving an issue with yet another form of symmetry.</p>

  ♦Self-harm is a major public health problem and adolescents are particularly at risk. In a newly published paper in BMC Public Health authors Ingri Myklestad and Melanie Straiton have investigated the relationship between self-harm and bullying behavior among adolescents.

  ♦<p>Self-harm is often the result of a complex interplay of genetic- biological, psychological and environmental factors. Bullying is one aspect that can increase the risk of self-harm. However not all adolescents who experience bullying harm themselves.</p>
<p>Bullies are also at risk</p>
<p>It is not only being the victim of bullying that is related to self-harm, but also being a bully aggressor. In fact, in our study we found that adolescents who are both bullies and are bullied by their peers (the bully-victims), were the group most vulnerable to self-harm. They were six times more likely to self-harm than adolescents who weren&#8217;t bullies or bullied.</p>
<p>It is possible that the “bully-victims” have the broadest range of adjustment problems, presenting difficulties common to both bullies and victims. An earlier study found that many of the bully-victims first have a history of being bullied, and then begin to bully peers later in adolescence. Thus, they suffer from both emotional and behavioral problems.</p>
<p>Why is there a relationship between self-harm and bullying behavior?</p>
<p>Both bullying victimization and self-harm are associated with emotional problems such as anxiety and depression. In our study we found that emotional problems and parental conflicts were important factors for the association between the bullied adolescents and self-harm, and between the bully-victims and self-harm.</p>
<p>Our study showed that school behavioral problems also accounted for some of the relationship between self-harm and the bullies, and self-harm and bully-victims. This confirms the idea that the act of bullying is part of a broader concept of conduct behavioral problems with aggressive and delinquent behaviors, school failure, and drop out.</p>
<p>Parental support and school well-being</p>
<blockquote><p>School well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullies and the bully-victims</p></blockquote>
<p>While we see that those who are bullied and/or bullies may be more likely to engage in self-harm, we know that not everyone who is bullied or bullies self-harms. We therefore investigated what might protect against self-harm amongst the bullies, bullied and bully-victims. We found that although parental support had a protective effect on self-harm among boys and girls in general, it was especially important for those who are bullied.</p>
<p>This shows that the willingness to talk to and seek help from parents during a difficult time like bullying, may protect against self-harm among adolescents.</p>
<p>We were surprised to also find that school well-being (including support from teacher) was protective of self-harm for the bullied and the bully-victims. Our result appears to be the first to investigate the buffering effect of school well-being on bullying behavior and self-harm among adolescents. This is an important result for the prevention of self-harm. Schools, parents, and health care professionals should be aware of the importance of school well-being for adolescents who are being bullied, in terms of identifying those at risk of self-harm.</p>
<p>How frequent is self-harm?</p>
<p>Our study showed that fifteen percent of participating adolescents reported engaging in self-harm during the last year. This is consistent with earlier studies finding the 12-month prevalence rate to be between 10 to 19% around the world.</p>
<p>Who participated in the study?</p>
<p>The data we used in this study was the “Ungdata” that is a cross-sectional, large, national survey, designed for adolescents. A total of 14 093 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, from different parts of Norway, participated in the study; this was 87% of those invited to participate.</p>
<p>Our data was collected at one point in time and therefore we do not know if the bullying occurred prior to self-harm. However, previous longitudinal studies have shown that bullying increased the risk of self-harm and not the other way around.</p>
<p>How we measured self-harm and bulling</p>
<p>We measured self-harm by asking if the adolescents had tried to harm them self in the past 12 months. Bullied was measured by asking adolescent if they had been teased, threatened, or frozen out by other young people in school, free time, online, or on their mobile phones. Bullying other peers was measured by asking if they had taken part in teasing, threatening or freezing out out other young people at school, free time, online or by mobile phone. We created a new variable to measure those both being bullied and who bully others (the bully-victims), by combining the variables “Bullied” and “Bullying other peers”.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<blockquote><p>High levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a strong link between bullying and self-harm. Interventions to address bullying may reduce self-harm. Our findings also suggest that high levels of parental support and school well-being may buffer the harmful relationship between bullying behavior and self-harm. Addressing these factors may be important in reducing the risk of self-harm among those experiencing bullying.</p>

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<p>PLOS Computational Biology has adopted an enhanced code sharing policy for all papers submitted from 30 March 2021. The change, announced in this editorial, comes in response to community needs and support for initiatives which drive Open Science practices.&nbsp;</p>



Community drivers



<p>Code sharing is not new to many of our authors. Research shows that 41% of papers in PLOS Computational Biology already share code voluntarily (Boudreau et al. 2021), demonstrating the community&rsquo;s willingness to make their work both rapidly available and methodologically transparent. This creates a strong foundation for implementing a stronger policy and also works towards establishing code sharing as a normal research behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS Computational Biology defines &ldquo;open&rdquo; as more than the availability of a research article. Our authors, editors, and readers see data and code sharing as tools to boost reproducibility and transparency. Sharing code alongside data will allow others to check and reproduce work and ultimately drive new discoveries. Requiring authors to share their code (unless there are good reasons not to) works towards making the research published in PLOS Computational Biology as robust as possible for the benefit of the whole research community.</p>



<p>In developing the policy we sought views from researchers in the computational community on the barriers they face when sharing code (Harney et al. 2021). We then tested our policy text with researchers to help inform its design and content. This has allowed us to respond to researcher needs, for example by allowing exemptions to the policy for those with legitimate legal or ethical constraints on sharing. In this way, PLOS Computational Biology continues to be shaped by policies the community has helped define, and Open Science values that reflect the way they want to communicate research.&nbsp;</p>



Open Science at PLOS



<p>Open Science is one of our founding principles at PLOS. Enhancing the code sharing policy at one of our journals in response to community needs is just one step we are making to increase the adoption of Open Science practices. We aim to empower researchers to share their good practices because we believe communities are best placed to define their own needs. The computational biology community is shaping the future of research communication by leading the way in practices that make science more open and equitable for all. However, we do offer guidance and help to those who need it, for example, by detailing best practice for code sharing alongside our policy text. No matter how researchers choose to make their work Open, PLOS Computational Biology provides options to support researcher needs and the platform to influence broader change.</p>



<p>Collaboration with the community and responding to their needs is part of our approach to Open Science, regardless of how that community is defined. We will be closely monitoring the reaction to the code sharing policy at PLOS Computational Biology and exploring what an enhanced policy could mean for other communities that we serve.&nbsp;</p>

  Everything’s glitzier in Las Vegas. The most intensely lit U.S. city shows the impact of artificial light on insects on a megascale.

  <p>The dazzling lights of Las Vegas are meant to attract. And on one summer night, they did just that, luring millions of grasshoppers— a whopping 30.2 metric tons’ worth.</p>



<p>That insect cloud gives us the first numbers for the size of artificial light’s impact on insects at such a large scale, says Elske Tielens, an ecologist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman.</p>



<p>That dramatic night, July 27, 2019, marked the peak of weeks of grasshoppers taking to the air after dark and, like moths bewitched by a porchlight, filling the brightly lit streets of the most intensely illuminated city in the United States. The spectacle made international news.</p>



<p>Just how big was it, Tielens and her colleagues wondered. They got to work, using Nevada weather-prediction radar data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration archives to study the horde of hard-to-count insects.</p>



♦This National Weather Service image shows radar reflecting off of a massive cloud of more than 45 million grasshoppers in the air above Las Vegas on the night of July 27, 2019.NWS Las Vegas



<p>These weren’t the fabled locust species that switch from a solitary phase to a physically distinct gregarious one that travels in great clouds eating plants down to the nubs (SN: 11/26/18; SN: 8/12/20). Instead they were pallid-winged grasshoppers (Trimerotropis pallidipennis) that had survived in unusual numbers after a generous, moist start of the year.</p>



<p>When the grasshoppers lifted up from the ground after dusk, the radar bounced off the loose mass of flying insects as it would any rain droplets and ice crystals. To predict the weather, “we filter out the biology,” Tielens says. For insect censusing, “we filter out all the ‘boring’ water drops and clouds.”</p>



<p>Each grasshopper weighs only about two-thirds of a gram, she and colleagues note March 31 in Biology Letters. So once the radar let the team determine the numbers, it estimated the total weight. “It’s a little dumbfounding to try to comprehend more than 45 million grasshoppers,” she says.</p>
