  Some immunocompromised people remain at risk for severe COVID-19 despite being vaccinated. Studies hint that an additional vaccine dose might help.

  <p>People with weak immune systems don’t always mount strong defenses against the coronavirus, even after being fully vaccinated. A third COVID-19 vaccine dose might help protect some immunocompromised people, evidence suggests. But for now, there’s not enough data to say how much such a shot might help, experts with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said July 22. As a result, the agency isn’t yet recommending a third dose and says that vaccinated people in this group should keep wearing masks.</p>



<p>With global COVID-19 cases on the rise, finding ways to protect millions of immunocompromised people who are at high risk for severe disease is crucial. In the United States, an estimated 2.7 percent of adults, or 6.8 million people, are immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies suggest that until transmission of the coronavirus is squashed, millions of organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing treatment and others are still susceptible to severe COVID-19, even if they are lucky enough to have access to shots (SN: 2/26/21). Of 45 vaccinated people admitted to 18 U.S. hospitals for COVID-19 from March 11 to May 5, twenty, or 44 percent, were immunocompromised, according to data presented in a July 22 meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. </p>

<p>A third dose of COVID-19 vaccines can boost coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the blood of some immunocompromised patients, laboratory studies suggest. But it’s still unclear whether specific groups might benefit more than others and how effective extra doses might be at preventing severe COVID-19. The immune system, for instance, has more than antibodies in its arsenal to attack the coronavirus and prevent severe disease (SN: 1/27/21). Studies from the real world would provide a clearer picture for how well additional doses might work, and for which groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the very least, an additional dose appears safe for immunocompromised individuals, epidemiologist Sara Oliver of the CDC said at the July 22 meeting. For example, a study that included patients on dialysis for kidney disease showed that “symptoms reported after the third dose were consistent with what has been seen after the second dose,” Oliver said. Most vaccine side effects — such as fatigue, pain at the injection site, chills or soreness — were mild.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While U.S. officials are still discussing the benefits of the additional dose, some countries have already taken steps to get those doses to immunocompromised residents. Severely immunocompromised people in France, for instance, can get a third dose a month after their second dose, officials announced April 11. Officials in Israel announced July 11 that they too would begin giving immunocompromised individuals a third shot. And officials in the United Kingdom have proposed distributing additional doses between September and December.&nbsp;</p>





See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak





<p>Here’s a summary of what studies have found so far about the merits of an extra COVID-19 shot for the immunocompromised:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — either Pfizer’s, Moderna’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — boosted the antibody levels of some organ transplant recipients with previously weak responses to the vaccine, researchers reported June 15 in Annals of Internal Medicine. Of 30 vaccinated patients, six people had low levels of antibodies that recognized the coronavirus before getting a third dose. Another 24 did not have detectable antibodies. Two weeks after their third shot, all six patients with initially low antibody levels now had high amounts. Of the 24 people without antibodies, 16 still didn’t develop any, two had low levels and six developed high levels of antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Another study showed that 67 out of 99 organ transplant recipients vaccinated with Pfizer’s jab had detectable antibodies after a third dose, researchers reported June 23 in the New England Journal of Medicine. That’s compared with four of 101 individuals after a first dose and 40 of 99 after a second. Of the 59 people who didn’t have antibodies after the second dose, 26, or 44 percent, mounted the immune proteins after the extra dose.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>More than 75 percent of blood, or hematopoietic, stem cell transplant recipients had detectable antibodies after two doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, researchers reported July 13 in the Lancet. Fifty-two of the 88 patients in the study had antibody levels above a threshold that corresponds to how well the immune proteins stop the coronavirus from infecting cells. Those who had received the transplant more than a year before getting vaccinated, and who had high numbers of pathogen-fighting white blood cells, were more likely to have lots of antibodies. Patients given treatments that suppressed their immune systems within three months of getting vaccinated, on the other hand, had low antibody levels, the team found. A third dose might be helpful for that group, but experts don’t know yet.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Third doses can also help some patients on dialysis for kidney disease, studies suggest. Of 12 dialysis patients who initially didn’t generate antibodies after two vaccine doses, half mounted an antibody response after an extra shot, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted July 6 at medRxiv.org. Forty-two percent, or 5 out of 12 antibody-negative patients, had antibodies after a third vaccine, another group of researchers reported May 31 in Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the United States, a recommendation for an additional dose for immunocompromised people probably won’t come unless the Food and Drug Administration permits extra doses under current emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines or until the agency fully approves the vaccines for widespread use, CDC officials said during the meeting. For now, the health agency isn’t aware of any data submitted to the FDA that might support such a change to the emergency use authorizations, the officials said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, experts are keeping a close eye on emerging data about additional doses. “However, while we do that, we need to remember what we can do now,” Oliver said. That means immunocompromised people should continue to wear masks, stay six feet away from others and avoid crowds or indoor spaces. </p>

  There are a few different methods to determine the age of a star, but none are perfect.

  <p>We know quite a lot about stars. After centuries of pointing telescopes at the night sky, astronomers and amateurs alike can figure out key attributes of any star, like its mass or its composition.</p>



<p>To calculate a star’s mass, just look it its orbital period and do a bit of algebra. To determine what it’s made of, look to the spectrum of light the star emits. But the one variable scientists haven’t quite cracked yet is time.</p>



<p>“The sun is the only star we know the age of,” says astronomer David Soderblom of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “Everything else is bootstrapped up from there.”</p>



<p>Even well-studied stars surprise scientists every now and then. In 2019 when the red supergiant star Betelgeuse dimmed, astronomers weren’t sure if it was just going through a phase or if a supernova explosion was imminent. (Turns out it was just a phase.) The sun also shook things up when scientists noticed that it wasn’t behaving like other middle-aged stars. It’s not as magnetically active compared with other stars of the same age and mass. That suggests that astronomers might not fully understand the timeline of middle age.</p>





<p>Calculations based on physics and indirect measurements of a star’s age can give astronomers ballpark estimates. And some methods work better for different types of stars. Here are three ways astronomers calculate the age of a star.</p>



Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams



<p>Scientists do have a pretty good handle on how stars are born, how they live and how they die. For instance, stars burn through their hydrogen fuel, puff up and eventually expel their gases into space, whether with a bang or a whimper. But when exactly each stage of a star’s life cycle happens is where things get complicated. Depending on their mass, certain stars hit those points after a different number of years. More massive stars die young, while less massive stars can burn for billions of years.</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, two astronomers — Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell — independently came up with the idea to plot stars’ temperature against their brightness. The patterns on these Hertzsprung-Russell, or H-R, diagrams corresponded to where different stars were in that life cycle. Today, scientists use these patterns to determine the age of star clusters, whose stars are thought to have all formed at the same time.</p>



<p>The caveat is that, unless you do a lot of math and modeling, this method can be used only for stars in clusters, or by comparing a single star’s color and brightness with theoretical H-R diagrams. “It’s not very precise,” says astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. “Nevertheless, it’s the best thing we’ve got.”</p>





Measuring a star’s age isn’t as easy as you’d think. Here’s how scientists get their ballpark estimates.

		<p>Tell us what you think of this video in a short survey.</p>
	




Rotation rate



<p>By the 1970s, astrophysicists had noticed a trend: Stars in younger clusters spin faster than stars in older clusters. In 1972, astronomer Andrew Skumanich used a star’s rotation rate and surface activity to propose a simple equation to estimate a star’s age: Rotation rate = (Age) -½.</p>



<p>This was the go-to method for individual stars for decades, but new data have poked holes in its utility. It turns out that some stars don’t slow down when they hit a certain age. Instead they keep the same rotation speed for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>“Rotation is the best thing to use for stars younger than the sun,” Metcalfe says. For stars older than the sun, other methods are better.</p>



Stellar seismology



<p>The new data that confirmed rotation rate wasn’t the best way to estimate an individual star’s age came from an unlikely source: the exoplanet-hunting Kepler space telescope. Not just a boon for exoplanet research, Kepler pushed stellar seismology to the forefront by simply staring at the same stars for a really long time.</p>



<p>Watching a star flicker can give clues to its age. Scientists look at changes in a star’s brightness as an indicator of what’s happening beneath the surface and, through modeling, roughly calculate the star’s age. To do this, one needs a really big dataset on the star’s brightness — which the Kepler telescope could provide.</p>



<p>“Everybody thinks it was all about finding planets, which was true,” Soderblom says. “But I like to say that the Kepler mission was a stealth stellar physics mission.”</p>



<p>This approach helped reveal the sun’s magnetic midlife crisis and recently provided some clues about the evolution of the Milky Way. Around 10 billion years ago, our galaxy collided with a dwarf galaxy. Scientists have found that stars left behind by that dwarf galaxy are younger or about the same age as stars original to the Milky Way. Thus, the Milky Way may have evolved more quickly than previously thought.</p>



<p>As space telescopes like NASA’s TESS and the European Space Agency’s CHEOPS survey new patches of sky, astrophysicists will be able to learn more about the stellar life cycle and come up with new estimates for more stars.</p>



<p>Aside from curiosity about the stars in our own backyard, star ages have implications beyond our solar system, from planet formation to galaxy evolution — and even the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>“One of these days — it’ll probably be a while — somebody’s going to claim they see signs of life on a planet around another star. The first question people will ask is, ‘How old is that star?’” Soderblom says. “That’s going to be a tough question to answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</p>



<p>Menopause involves the brain, not just the ovaries — and more research is needed to understand these neurological effects. This work could help doctors improve treatment for the symptoms of menopause, and even aid in our understanding of diseases like Alzheimer’s, explains Kim Tingley at The New York Times.</p>











<p>How have lockdowns and social distancing affected our memory? Julia Shaw takes a look at BBC Science Focus.</p>







<p>A recent study found that people who are good at “bullshitting” tend to be more intelligent. At The Observer, Ian Tucker interviews researcher Martin Turpin about the intriguing results (and see also our recent story on whether you can bullshit a bullshitter…)</p>







<p>It’s great that we’re increasingly recognising the problem of burnout at work — but we need to actually make systematic changes that tackle the issue across the workforce, argues Victoria Turk at Wired. As we figure out what the future of work will look like post-Covid, we need to grapple with the inequalities and organisational failures that lead to people burning out.</p>







<p>How does the development of motor skills relate to the development of language? New Scientist has a short video on work comparing the motor abilities of chimps and children. The researchers hope that a better understanding of typical motor development and how this relates to language skills will ultimately lead to early detection of those at risk of language difficulties.</p>







<p>Humans aren’t the only creatures to play with each other — many animals learn new skills through play. At Scientific American, Caitlin O’Connell recounts her experiences watching elephants play, and explains how vital it is to their development.</p>







<p>Can dogs understand when someone is lying or being deceptive? That’s the claim of a new study, which Christa Lesté-Lasserre covers at New Scientist.</p>







<p>Even though we generally seek out positive experiences, when it comes to charitable giving we are willing to put ourselves through pain and discomfort (think of the ubiquitous charity marathon) — and we will even pay for the privilege of doing so. Actions that require more pain and effort also attract more donations, researchers have found, and it all comes down to something called the “martyrdom effect”, explain Gary Mortimer and colleagues at The Conversation.</p>

  An ancient shark bite victim died quickly, before his body was recovered and buried, a new study finds.

  <p>Somewhere off southeastern Japan’s coast around 3,000 years ago, a shark attacked and killed a man who was likely fishing or shellfish diving. Afterward, the victim’s fishing comrades presumably brought the body, minus its sheared off right leg and left hand, back to land for burial.</p>



<p>A new analysis of that unfortunate man’s partial skeleton, excavated around a century ago at a village cemetery near Japan’s Seto Inland Sea, has unveiled that grisly scenario. This individual from Japan’s ancient Jōmon culture (SN: 2/15/97) represents the oldest known human victim of a shark attack, say archaeologist J. Alyssa White of the University of Oxford and colleagues. Radiocarbon dating places his death from 3,391 to 3,031 years ago, the researchers report in the August Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.</p>



<p>A roughly 1,000-year-old skeleton of a fisherman on Puerto Rico previously displayed the earliest signs of a shark encounter.</p>



<p>White’s group documented at least 790 gouges, punctures and other types of bite damage mainly confined to the Jōmon man’s arms, legs, pelvis and ribs. A 3-D model of these injuries indicates that the victim first lost his left hand trying to fend off a shark. Ensuing bites severed major leg arteries, rapidly leading to death.</p>



<p>After the man’s body was recovered, his mutilated left leg probably detached and was placed on his chest when he was buried, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Numerous shark teeth found at some Jōmon sites suggest that sharks were hunted, perhaps by drawing them to blood while fishing at sea. “But unprovoked shark attacks would have been incredibly rare as sharks do not tend to target humans as prey,” White says.</p>

We explore how the brain uses electrical signaling in surprising ways, beginning with a look at how an action potential (aka. "the spike") is produced. Then we consider what Humphries calls "the dark neurons," which are neurons that rarely generate spikes. We explore their role and also how it relates to the brain's spontaneous activity. One of the more surprising recent discoveries in neuroscience is that most of the brain's activity does not appear to be caused by external stimuli.

  Analyses of seismic waves picked up by NASA’s InSight lander shed new light on the planet’s core and give clues to the thickness of the crust.

  <p>Mars has had its first CT scan, thanks to analyses of seismic waves picked up by NASA’s InSight lander. Diagnosis: The Red Planet’s core is at least partially liquid, as some previous studies had suggested, and is somewhat larger than expected.</p>



<p>InSight reached Mars in late 2018 and soon afterward detected the first known marsquake (SN: 11/26/18; SN: 4/23/19). Since then, the lander’s instruments have picked up more than a thousand temblors, most of them minor rumbles. Many of those quakes originated at a seismically active region more than 1,000 kilometers away from the lander. A small fraction of the quakes had magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 4.0, and the resulting vibrations have enabled scientists to probe Mars and reveal new clues about its inner structure.</p>



<p>Simon Stähler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich, and colleagues analyzed seismic waves from 11 marsquakes, looking for two types of waves: pressure and shear. Unlike pressure waves, shear waves can’t pass through a liquid, and they move more slowly, traveling side to side through solid materials, rather than in a push-and-pull motion in the same direction a wave is traveling like pressure waves do.</p>







<p>Of those 11 events, six sets of vibrations included shear waves strong enough to stand out from background noise. The strength of those shear waves suggests that they reflected off of the outer surface of a liquid core, rather than entering a solid core and being partially absorbed, Stähler says. And the difference in arrival times at InSight for the pressure waves and shear waves for each quake suggest that Mars’ core is about 3,660 kilometers in diameter, he and colleagues report in the July 23 Science.</p>



<p>That’s a little more than half of the diameter of the entire planet, larger than most previous estimates. The Red Planet’s core is so big, in fact, that it blocks InSight from receiving certain types of seismic waves from a large part of the planet. That, in turn, suggests that Mars may be more seismically active than the lander’s sensors can detect. Indeed, one of the regions in the lander’s seismic blind spot is the Tharsis region, home to some of Mars’ largest volcanoes. Volcanic activity there, as well as the motion of molten rock within the crust in that region, could trigger quakes or seismic waves.</p>



♦Seismic waves (red lines in this illustration) traveling through Mars from a quake’s source (example, red dot) to the InSight lander (white dot) reveal the Red Planet’s internal structure, including a massive core (yellow-white) more than half the diameter of the planet.Chris Bickel/Science



<p>While the newly analyzed data confirm the planet’s outer core is liquid, it’s not clear yet whether Mars has a solid inner core like Earth, says study coauthor Amir Khan, a geophysicist also at ETH Zurich. “The signal should be there in the seismic data,” he says. “We just need to locate it.”</p>



<p>In a separate analysis also published in Science, Khan and colleagues suggest that InSight’s seismic blind spot may also stem, in part, from the way that seismic waves slow down and bend as they travel deep within the planet. Changes in seismic wave speed and direction can result from gradual variations in rock temperature or density, for example.</p>



<p>Mars’ seismic waves also hint at the thickness of the planet’s crust. As they bounce back and forth within the planet, the waves bounce off interfaces between different layers and types of rocks, says Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun, a seismologist at the University of Cologne in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In a separate study in Science, she and her team analyzed seismic signals that reflected off several such interfaces near Mars’ surface, making it difficult to determine the depth at which the planet’s crust ends and the underlying mantle begins, she says. The researchers concluded, however, that the average thickness of the crust likely lies between 24 and 72 kilometers. For comparison, Earth’s oceanic crust is about 6 to 7 kilometers thick, while the planet&#8217;s continental crust averages from 35 to 40 kilometers thick.</p>



<p>Together, these seismic analyses are the first to investigate the innards of a rocky planet other than Earth, Stähler says. As such, they provide “ground truth” for measurements made by spacecraft orbiting Mars, and could help scientists better interpret data gathered from orbit around other planets, such as Mercury and Venus.</p>



<p>The findings could also provide insights that would help planetary scientists better understand how Mars formed and evolved over the life of the solar system, and how the Red Planet ended up so unalike Earth, says Sanne Cottaar, a geophysicist at the University of Cambridge. Cottaar wrote a commentary, also published in Science, on the new research. “Mars was put together with similar building blocks” as Earth, she says, “but had a different result.”</p>

  <p>Pterosaur hatchlings may have been able to fly right out of the shell — although the flight of those ancient baby reptiles might have looked a bit different from that of the adults.</p>



<p>A new analysis of the fossilized wing bones of embryonic, newly hatched and adult pterosaurs suggests the baby creatures were strong and nimble fliers from the start, researchers report July 22 in Scientific Reports.</p>



<p>Pterosaurs were a diverse group of ancient flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs from the Triassic to the Cretaceous periods, 228 million to 66 million years ago. The group includes Quetzalcoatlus northropi, the largest creature known to take wing, and Kunpengopterus antipollicatus (aka “Monkeydactyl”) which had opposable thumbs that enabled it to climb trees (SN: 4/14/21).</p>



<p>Scientists know relatively little about the early life history of pterosaurs, including whether their young could actively flap their wings or only glide — which might mean they stayed under parental care until they were flight-ready. But recent revelations increasingly point toward early independence, or “precociality,” for the reptiles, such as finding flight membranes on the wings of an embryonic pterosaur, and the discovery of a tiny Pteranodon juvenile that was capable of long-distance flying long before it had grown to adult size.</p>





<p>“Baby pterosaurs almost certainly didn’t glide,” they flew, says Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the new study. The three keys to flight, he says, are strong bones, sufficient muscle mass to stay in the air for a long time and sturdy keratin fibers in the skin of the wings, analogous to the feathers of birds. “We know little about the last two.”</p>



<p>So researchers turned to the bones. Darren Naish, a paleontologist at the University of Southampton in England, and his colleagues compared fossilized embryo and hatchling wing measurements with those of adults from two species, Pterodaustro guinazui and Sinopterus dongi. The researchers analyzed wingspans, the strength of wing bones and how much load the wings could carry. In particular, they zeroed in on one wing bone, the humerus. That bone is found on the limbs pterosaurs use to launch themselves into flight and offers key information on whether a pterosaur was capable of getting off the ground.</p>



<p>The hatchlings’ humerus bones were surprisingly stronger than those of many of the adults, the team found. The hatchlings also had shorter and broader wings than the adults, suggesting they might have been capable of nimbly changing direction and speed, if not flying long distances (SN: 10/12/10).</p>



<p>Agile flying may have helped the hatchlings not only escape predators, but also chase tricky prey such as insects, all while navigating dense vegetation, the team suggests. Adult pterosaurs, less able to maneuver due to their size, may have then switched to more open habitats.</p>



<p>Among modern birds, the ability to fly immediately after hatching is almost unknown — with the notable exception of the maleo, a strange chickenlike bird that lives only on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The maleo’s ability to take flight right away helps it avoid being snapped up by the island’s various predators, from monitor lizards to pythons.</p>



<p>Still, it isn’t unusual in most of the animal world for young to be able to fend for themselves, Padian says. “Precociality is the rule, not the exception, in vertebrates,” he says. Only animals with extended parental care — like songbirds or primates — can afford to be helpless for any extended period of time.</p>

  <p>In point-scanning microscopy like two-photon or confocal microscopy, a focused laser beam is scanned across the field of view and thereby sequentially recovers an image of the object. In this blog post, I will discuss the idea that scanning faster across the field of view would increase the total amount of collected fluorescence. This idea is based on the experimental finding that high-intensity laser light could induce long-lived and non-fluorescent triplet states of the fluorophore molecule while scanning the sample; when the laser is scanned only slowly across the sample, it would therefore try to image fluorophores that are already in their &#8220;dark&#8221; triplet states. Imaging dark fluorophores would result in an overall decreased fluorescence yield. I tested this hypothesis directly with resonant scanning two-photon microscopy in the living brain tissue together with typical fluorophores (GCaMP6f, OGB-1). The main result from these experiments is that I could not find a substantial effect of the triplet states under these realistic conditions, and therefore no advantage in terms of fluorescence yield gained by an increased scan speed.</p>



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>Fluorophores are molecules that can re-emit light after absorbing a photon themselves. This effect of fluorescence can be described as a state change of the fluorophore from ground state to an excited state upon absorption of the incoming photon, and as a state change from an excited state back to the ground state, together with emission of the outgoing photon (see this Wikipedia article). The lifetime of the fluorescent state is often a few nanoseconds. However, there are often additional excited states that are more long-lived, such as so-called triplet states. The transition probabilities from ground state to triplet state (and vice versa) are very low due to the exclusion principle that derives from quantum spin mechanics. The lower transition probabilities make these states less likely to occur during fluorescence microscopy but also render the triplet state longer-lived once it is attained. These long-lived triplet states could have rather undesired consequences, since a fluorophore in the triplet state is unable to absorb or emit photons, therefore becoming &#8220;dark&#8221; or non-functional from the experimenter&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<p>When triplet states play a prominent role in laser-scanning microscopy, one can avoid their detrimental effects by simply scanning faster. Scanning slowly across the sample means that the same fluorophores are hit with light over and over within a short time window. In such a scenario, some of the fluorophores are already in a dark triplet states, resulting in lower overall fluorescence. Faster scanning avoids this problem, and it has been shown for confocal microscopy (Borlinghaus, 2006) as well as STEP microscopy (Schneider et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015) that a large signal increase can be achieved simply by faster scanning.</p>



<p>For two-photon microscopy, the situation is less clear. It has been shown that scanning at all compared to non-scanning two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results in higher photon yield (Petrášek and Schwille, 2008), but this specific fluorescence configuration cannot be translated easily to two-photon imaging used by neuroscientists. However, there is one publication that demonstrated that microsecond-long triplet states do play a large role for two-photon microscopy (Donnert et al., 2007). This paper has been cited as a standard reference to justify the advantages of fast scanning approaches (e.g., Chen et al., 2011), and some two-photon microscopy approaches directly designed their scanning approaches to reduce triplet-induced reduction of fluorescence yield (Gautam et al., 2015; Castanares et al., 2016; Karpf et al., 2020). However, another study showed an effect that seemed to be contradictory to the Donnert et al. results (Ji et al., 2008), and the interpretation of both papers was discussed repeatedly, e.g., by Andrew Hires and on Labrigger. The consensus, if there was any, seemed to be that it probably depends on the sample. The experiments by Donnert et al. had been done with GFP fixed on a coverslip, but one can easily imagine that a fluorescent protein in vivo might behave differently.</p>



<p>So I decided to probe these results with typical samples and procedures used by neuroscientists &#8211; using video-rate calcium imaging of neurons in the living brain. I did not do this out of pure curiosity about photophysics, but because of the implications of these photophysics for the design of two-photon imaging modalities. If triplet states were indeed an important factor for two-photon imaging of such samples as suggested by Donnert et al., a slightly modified scanning scheme (or parallelized scanning schemes, as reviewed by Weissenburger and Vaziri, 2018, Figure 3) or adapted laser repetition rates would have huge benefits for the total fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>The main finding of the Donnert et al. paper was the induction of dark triplet states by the scanning laser, and a key prediction was that faster scanning would decrease the probability that an imaged fluorophore is in a dark state; in short, that faster scanner would increase fluorescence yield. Therefore, I wanted to systematically understand whether fluorescence for two-photon microscopy depends on scan speed. To study this dependence experimentally in a typical in vivo sample , I used a resonant scanning microscope. For a resonant scanning microscope, the physical scan speed across the sample can be adjusted by changing the scan amplitude (often called the Zoom setting). High zoom would result in low scan speed across the sample, while low zoom would result in high scan speed, enabling a simple characterization of scan speed versus fluorescence yield. According to Donnert et al., higher scan speed would result in higher fluorescence yield compared to slower scan speed when imaging the same spot.</p>



<p>Experimental approach</p>



<p>For a resonant scanning microscope, the scan speed can be derived from the position x(t) of the laser beam focus:</p>



<p>♦,</p>



<p>with the resonant frequency (f = 8 kHz) and the amplitude (x0 = 500 μm), which determines roughly the size of the field of view (FOV, here: 1000 μm). The scan speed v(t) is the derivative of the position x(t) with respect to time and therefore also follows a sinusoidal trajectory that reaches its peak in the center of the FOV:</p>



<p>♦,</p>



<p>with the speed at the center of the FOV given by</p>



<p>♦.</p>



<p>For higher zoom values (i.e., a smaller FOV), the value is reduced by the same factor (at least in the microscopy software I used for these experiments!). Thereby, it is possible to test a wide range of scan speeds just be changing the zoom setting of the resonant scanner. Since the resonant scanner can span zoom levels between 1x to 20x (for much higher zoom settings, a resonant scanner can become unstable due to the small scan amplitude), a range of speeds between 25 μm/μs and 1.25 μm/μs is spanned.</p>



<p>This speed should be compared to the lateral resolution of the microscope, which is for the  microscope used in this experiment around 0.4 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum of the point spread function). To scan over this resolution-limited spot, the resonant scanner needs 0.016 &#8211; 0.32 μs. For a pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 80 MHz with 12.5 ns between two pulses, this corresponds to 1.3 &#8211; 26 pulses per resolution-limited spot. Let&#8217;s call this number the cumulative pulse count per resolution-limited spot (CPC) from now on.</p>



<p>Intuitively, this means that each time a laser pulse tries to excite a fluorophore, this fluorophore has very recently already been hit by a number n of previous pulses, approximately n = CPC/2. If there is a chance that a pulse drives the fluorophore into a dark state that makes the fluorophore non-excitable for a handful of microseconds (e.g., a triplet state), then the CPC can be used to calculate the number of fluorophores remaining to be excited:</p>



<p>♦</p>



<p>λ is a constant that depends on the applied laser intensity and the fluorophore itself. More concretely, the constant λ is the event rate of a fluorophore going into the dark state. The exponential decay with CPC should hold true as long as these events occur within a time window that is shorter than the recovery timescale of the dark state (for triplet states, this is ca. 1 μs). The main consequence is that the fluorescence yield is obviously proportional to the remaining number of excitable fluorophores, Nremaining.</p>



<p>Therefore, if these events that generate dark triplet states were very unlikely (e.g., λ ~ 500), the effect of fast scanning would not really make a difference. However, if λ was ~1, the effects would be dramatic. How can we distinguish these scenarios?</p>



<p>Experimental implementation, part I</p>



<p>With a resonant scanning microscope, the experiment is easy to perform for a dye in a solution. You simply have to generate a homogeneous sample and image first with high zoom and low zoom, then compare the fluorescence in the central region where the scan speed is maximal.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, biological samples are not homogeneous, and also not stationary in the case of calcium indicators in living neurons. To image in a biological but still rather homogeneous sample, I used a transgenic GCaMP6f zebrafish line. I imaged in an explant of a dorsal forebrain region that I knew was labeled very densely and very homogeneously (described by Huang et al., 2020). But the neuronal somata with the nice nuclear exclusion of GCaMP generated a lot of undesired variability.</p>



<p>The solution to circumvent these sources of variability is systematic averaging. In a first approach, I took advantage of the fact that I had written large parts of the microscopy control software myself. I wrote a helper program that performed continuous imaging but randomly moved the stage to different positions every few seconds, thereby averaging across all these inhomogeneously labeled FOVs:</p>









<p>After a minute, the program automatically changed the Zoom setting to a different, random value and recorded again the video with intermittent stage movements:</p>









<p>To see an effect, I performed these experiments with rather high laser power (50-80 mW below the objective) and at rather low wavelengths (typically 800 nm, which had been used previously by Donnert et al.).</p>



<p>In the following plot, each data point corresponds to one movie as shown above. Keep in mind that a zoom setting corresponds to a specific CPC. For example, a zoom setting of 1 corresponds to a CPC of 1.3. However, I could not see any dependence of the total fluorescence on the cumulative pulse count CPC (left), so it was not worth determining a numeric value for λ. Interestingly, the total fluorescence decreased slightly but clearly visible over time (right), but since the zoom setting sequence was randomized, this did not reflect any dependence on the CPC:</p>



♦



<p>This finding also held true for repetitions of the same experiment at different locations of the fish brain and with slightly changed wavelength or average power:</p>



♦



<p>Next, I performed the same experiment with a different fluorophore. I injected OGB-1 into the homolog of piriform cortex of zebrafish. This is a large and relatively uniform region in the zebrafish forebrain that allows the dye to diffuse more or less homogeneously, at least if you&#8217;re lucky. When I analyzed the experiments, I found again no visible effect, no matter the laser power or the laser wavelength:</p>



♦



<p>Together, these experiments strongly suggested that there is indeed no effect of triplet states and therefore no benefit of fast scanning to increase the fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>Experimental implementation, part II</p>



<p>However, to convince myself more about this experimental finding that seemed to be at odds with my expectations from the Donnert et al. paper, I used a second, slightly more direct approach. Instead of comparing sequential recordings at different zoom levels, I thought it would be interesting to record the fluorescence while changing the zoom level continuously. This would enable me to measure the dependence of fluorescence on CPC more quickly and therefore also for a larger set of power settings and wavelengths. To continuously change the zoom setting, I used a DAQ board to generate a low-frequency sine signal that modulated the zoom level from 1 (peak of the sine) to ~20 (trough of the sine) with a period of ca. 13 seconds. (To keep track of the sine signal, I also connected the command signal with the second input channel of the microscope.) That&#8217;s how these experiments looked like:</p>









<p>Of course it is important to use not the entire FOV but only the central vertical stripe that remains more or less stationary. I used only a small vertical window of 7 pixels for the analysis. A single experiments resulted in a result such as shown below, plotting CPC (top) and fluorescence (bottom). The fluorescence clearly shows some variability stemming from active neurons (after all, we&#8217;re still dealing with a living brain here!):</p>



♦



<p>In the plot above, no obvious relationship between CPC and fluorescence can be seen, and when I changed the power at 920 nm between 15 mW and 60 mW (this was the maximum that I could get with this system), I could not see any effect. I therefore show here all experiments performed at 920 nm, pooled across power settings and across two fish (total of ca. 30 recordings, each a few minutes):</p>



♦



<p>For some experiments, the maximum zoom level was around 14, which I extended for a subset of experiments to something closer to 20.</p>



<p>I performed the same experiment also at 800 nm. I could also increase the laser power, simply because the laser provided more power at this wavelength range. However, these levels cannot go to arbitrary values. At a certain threshold that also depends on the duration of the exposure, all neurons across the zebrafish&#8217;s brain region become bright, resulting in a wave of high-calcium neurons that propagates through the brain. To avoid this, I used a maximum power of 75 mW at 800 nm. The result, again pooled across laser powers between 40 and 75 mW, showed an effect, albeit a bit subtle:</p>



♦



<p>Fluorescence was indeed slightly higher for very low CPCs. However, the effect was much smaller than expected from experiments in vitro by Donnert et al.. Overall, such a small effect which, in addition, only appeared at the less relevant wavelength of 800 nm, seemed of little relevance for practical purposes.</p>



<p>Therefore, with fluorescence depending on CPC only in minor ways and under non-typical imaging conditions, the suggested triplet states seem to be not relevant for in vivo calcium imaging situations; and as a consequence, one would be ill-guided to assume that faster scanning yields higher fluorescence yield for two-photon microscopy by avoiding these μs-long dark states.</p>



<p>As a side-note, when I tried to analyze the power-dependency of this weak effect observed at 800 nm, I came across a weird effect. There was indeed some sort of increased fluorescence at lower zoom levels. However, this increase came with a delay of several seconds during the above experiments, resulting in a hysteresis:</p>



♦



<p>Due to this longer time-scale, this effect has nothing to do with the short-lived μs-triplet states but is something different entirely. Photophysics is really complicated! This additional observation made me stop experiments, because I realized that these things would be more difficult to figure out, on top of a very small and probably irrelevant triplet effect.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>I did not find any evidence for a substantial effect of triplet states during typical conditions (calcium imaging of neurons with a Ti:Sa laser and &lt;100 mW power at the sample). I therefore do not see a benefit in terms of fluorescence yield by faster scanning. The triplet states on the timescale of few microseconds that had been observed by Donnert et al. for fixed samples do not seem to play a major role under the investigated conditions. It is always challenging to convincingly show the absence of an effect, but my experimental results convinced me to not further investigate fast scanning and multiplexing schemes as a means to increase fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>Multiplexing or other modified distributions of excitation photons in time and space might still be able to increase fluorescence yield for certain fluorophores and conditions, but probably not under conditions similar to the ones I investigated.</p>



<p>The experiments described above are not fully systematic and cover only a specific parameter regime of excitation wavelengths, fluorophores and laser powers. However, anybody with a resonantly scanning two-photon microscope can easily reproduce these findings for any other scenario. Simply switch between high and low zoom settings and check whether the brightness in the center of the FOV changed substantially or not. Quantification of possible effects requires careful averaging, but a quick and qualitative confirmation or refutation of the above findings would be very easy to do for any experimenter.</p>



<p>Acknowledgements</p>



<p>The experiments described above were carried out in the lab of Rainer Friedrich at the FMI in Basel. I&#8217;m thankful to Christian Wilms, who found these (negative) findings interesting and encouraged me to write them up after a discussion on Twitter that made me look again into this dataset.</p>

  Images show that the coronavirus clears the respiratory tract of hairlike structures called cilia, which keep foreign objects out of the lungs.

  <p>A coronavirus infection can mow down the forests of hairlike cilia that coat our airways, destroying a crucial barrier to keeping the virus from lodging deep in the lungs.</p>



<p>Normally, those cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus out of the airway and into the throat. To protect the lungs, objects that don’t belong — including viral invaders like the coronavirus — get stuck in mucus, which is then swallowed (SN: 9/15/20).</p>



<p>But the coronavirus throws that system out of whack. When it infects respiratory tract cells, the virus appears to clear tracts of cilia, and without the hairlike structures, the cells stop moving mucus, researchers report July 16 in Nature Communications.</p>

<p>That lack of cilia could help the virus invade the lungs and cause severe COVID-19, says Lisa Chakrabarti, a viral immunologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (SN: 6/11/20). Understanding how the coronavirus invades different parts of the body can help researchers find ways to block it.</p>



<p>Chakrabarti and colleagues infected lab-grown human cells that mimic the lining of the respiratory tract with the coronavirus. Images showed short, stubby cilia on the surface of the infected cells rather than the long projections found on healthy cells. When the team added microscopic beads to the surface of infected cells to measure mucus movement, those beads largely stayed still — a sign that the cells wouldn’t move mucus through the respiratory tract and into the throat to be swallowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





Normally, cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus away from the lungs, toward the throat where foreign objects are swallowed. But coronavirus-infected cells lose those cilia and no longer push mucus, eliminating a barrier that would normally help prevent the virus from invading the lungs. Here microscopic beads move around the surface of uninfected lab-grown cells first and then around infected cells, illustrating mucus movement. The colored lines show how fast the beads are moving, with blue indicating slower speeds and red noting faster speeds.



<p>Other viruses and bacteria can also damage the body’s ability to use mucus to trap and remove foreign invaders, Chakrabarti says. Some pathogens, like the coronavirus, just damage cilia, leaving the cells they protrude from intact. Other pathogens — like influenza — can kill ciliated cells. Respiratory syncytial virus, which typically causes colds, can do both: In adults, it destroys cilia; in children, it can kill the cells, which can be deadly. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars has seen its future, and it’s full of rocks. Lots and lots of rocks. After spending the summer trundling through Jezero Crater and checking out the sights, it’s now time for Percy to get to work, teasing out the geologic history of its new home and seeking out signs of ancient microbial life.</p>



<p>“We’ve actually been on a road trip,” project manager Jennifer Trosper, who is based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said at a July 21 news conference. “And during it, we will take our very first sample from the surface of Mars.”</p>



<p>Percy is about 1 kilometer south of where it landed on February 18 (SN: 2/17/21). After driving itself around a region of sand dunes, accompanied by its tagalong helicopter Ingenuity (SN: 4/30/21), the robotic explorer has pulled up to its first sampling spot: a garden of flat, pale stones dubbed paver stones. “This is the area where we are really going to be digging in, both figuratively and literally, to understand the rocks that we have been on for the last several months,” said Kenneth Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech.</p>



<p>The team has been trying to figure out whether these rocks are volcanic or sedimentary. “We still don’t have the answer,” Farley said. Images taken a few centimeters above the surface show what the team is up against: The rocks are littered with dust and pebbles, probably blown in from elsewhere, and the smoother surfaces have a mysterious purplish coating. “All of these factors conspire to prevent us from peering into the rock and actually seeing what it is made out of,” he said.</p>





<p>In the coming weeks, Percy will bore a smooth cavity in one of those rocks and get below the surface crud. Instruments on its robotic arm will then move in close to produce detailed chemical and mineralogical maps that will reveal the rocks’ true nature. Then, sometime in mid-August, the team will extract its first sample. That sample will go into a tube that will eventually get dropped off — along with samples from other locales — for some future mission to pick up and bring to Earth (SN: 7/28/20).</p>



<p>Cameras scouting farther afield have turned up future sampling sites. A small far-off hill shows hints of finely layered rock that may be mud deposits. “This is exactly the kind of rock that we are most interested in investigating for looking for potential biosignatures,” Farley said.</p>



<p>And the way that rocks are strewn about an ancient river delta in the distance suggests that the lake that once filled Jezero Crater went through multiple episodes of filling in and drying up. If true, Farley said, then the crater may have preserved “multiple time periods when we might be able to look for evidence of ancient life that might have existed on the planet.”</p>

  <p>A Venus’s-flower-basket isn’t all show. This stunning deep-sea sponge can also alter the flow of seawater in surprising ways.</p>



<p>A lacy, barrel-shaped chamber forms the sponge’s glassy skeleton. Flow simulations reveal how this intricate structure alters the way water moves around and through the sponge, helping it endure unforgiving ocean currents and perhaps feed and reproduce, researchers report online July 21 in Nature.</p>



<p>Previous studies have found that the gridlike construction of a Venus’s-flower-basket (Euplectella aspergillum) is strong and flexible. “But no one has ever tried to see if these beautiful structures have fluid-dynamic properties,” says mechanical engineer Giacomo Falcucci of Tor Vergata University of Rome.</p>



<p>Harnessing supercomputers, Falcucci and colleagues simulated how water flows around and through the sponge’s body, with and without different skeletal components such as the sponge’s myriad pores. If the sponge were a solid cylinder, water flowing past would form a turbulent wake immediately downstream that could jostle the creature, Falcucci says. Instead water flows through and around the highly porous Venus’s-flower-basket and forms a gentle zone of water that flanks the sponge and displaces turbulence downstream, the team found. That way, the sponge’s body endures less stress.</p>





<p>Ridges that spiral around the outside of the sponge’s skeleton also somehow cause water to slow and swirl inside the structure, the simulations showed. As a result, food and reproductive cells that drift into the sponge would become trapped for up to twice as long as in the same sponge without ridges. That lingering could help the filter feeders catch more plankton. And because Venus’s-flower-baskets can reproduce sexually, it could also enhance the chances that free-floating sperm encounter eggs, the researchers say.</p>



<p>It’s amazing that such beauty could be so functional, Falcucci says. The sponge’s flow-altering abilities, he says, might help inspire taller, more wind-resistant skyscrapers.</p>



♦This simulation shows how water flows around and through a Venus’s-flower-basket (gray). Ridges that spiral across the outside of the sponge cause water inside to somehow slow and swirl, forming particle-trapping vortices. And the sponge’s shape creates a gentle zone of slower water that forms immediately downstream, buffering the creature against turbulence. Vertical cross sections contrast the flow activity of the calm zone (nearer the sponge) and the turbulent zone (downstream).G. Falcucci et al/Nature 2021

  <p>By Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Having a &#8220;choice mindset&#8221; — believing, in short, that people’s behaviours are “choices”, or deliberate actions driven by their own motives and preferences — has multiple benefits. Those with a choice mindset feel as if they have control over their own destiny, for example, and see better outcomes in negotiations.</p>



<p>There are some drawbacks, however. Choice mindsets can lead to victim blaming, a lack of care about inequality, and a reduced interest in acts of social good. A new study in Social Psychological and Personality Science takes a closer look at these more troublesome impacts. Yidan Yin from UC San Diego and colleagues find that people in positions of power tend to adopt a choice mindset, which makes them more likely to blame others for mistakes.</p>







<p>In the first study, 363 participants completed two surveys in a random order. One measured participants’ sense of power, asking how much they agreed with statements such as “I can get others to do what I want”. The other looked at their tendency to apportion blame. Participants were told that the researchers were crowdsourcing a solution to a real issue in their department: whether or not to give a bonus to an administrative assistant who had failed to meet a deadline for a grant, and claimed she had no choice because she was “caught up in other work”. They were then asked how much choice the assistant had in not completing the work, and whether or not they believed she was to blame for missing the deadline. Finally, they were asked to vote on whether or not she should receive the bonus.</p>



<p>The team found that participants with a higher sense of power believed the assistant had more choice, and were less likely to vote to give her a bonus. Similarly, those who perceived the assistant to have more choice blamed her more. This remained the case even when excluding participants who did not believe the scenario was real.</p>



<p>In the second study, the team looked at what happened when people were made to feel more or less powerful. Participants were told they had been placed into teams to rank in order of importance a list of tips about how to succeed on Mechanical Turk (the crowdsourcing website&nbsp; where the study took place). In the low power condition, participants were told they had been assigned the role of a &#8220;worker&#8221; who was inferior to other teammates, while in the high power condition they were a supervisor.</p>



<p>Participants were then asked to summarise a transcription another team had supposedly made: the transcription was full of errors, which they were told was because the worker’s internet connection was unstable. They then answered questions about the transcription, indicating whether they believed the transcriber had a choice about correcting their errors, how much they were to blame, and whether they should receive payment for the transcription.</p>



<p>Again, participants in the high power group were both more likely to perceive the transcriber as having a choice than those in the low power group, which in turn made them more likely to blame and punish the transcriber by indicating they should not be paid. A third study also replicated these findings.</p>



<p>In all three studies, participants who felt more powerful were also more likely to see others as having more choice and, therefore, to blame them more when something went wrong — even if a reasonable explanation was given. As the team notes, this can’t just be because those in positions of power want to preserve their own position: in the first study, participants were asked to make a decision about someone completely unrelated to them and their own place in a social hierarchy. Instead, it may be that powerful people benefit psychologically from believing everyone’s position is related to choice, meaning they had reached their own position through merit and hard work.</p>



<p>Those in serious positions of power, such as policymakers and politicians, should therefore carefully consider how much choice people actually have in different situations. Are people “choosing” to remain on benefits, to use one issue highlighted by the team, or are they simply dealing with the constraints of their life and the world as best they can? If powerful people think more critically about when we really do have choice and when we don&#8217;t, it could avoid them unfairly blaming or punishing others.</p>



<p>&#8211; Power Increases Perceptions of Others’ Choices, Leading People to Blame Others More</p>

  <p>A century ago, the Milky Way galaxy was the entirety of the known universe. We had no idea what made the stars shine, and only one star — our own sun — was known to harbor any planets. Of those planets, humans had explored only one: Earth.</p>



<p>“The stellar universe, as we know it … is a flattened, watch-shaped organization of stars and nebulae,” astronomer Harlow Shapley wrote in Science News Bulletin, the earliest version of Science News, in August 1921 (SN: 8/8/1921, p. 3). That sparkling pocket watch was the Milky Way, and at the time Shapley wrote this, astronomers were just beginning to conceive that anything at all might lie beyond it.</p>



<p>Today, spacecraft have flown by every one of the solar system’s planets, taking close-ups of their wildly alien faces. The solar system, it turns out, contains a cornucopia of small rocky and icy bodies that have challenged the very definition of a planet. Thousands of planets have been spotted orbiting other stars, some of which may have the right conditions for life to thrive. And the Milky Way, we now know, is just one of billions of galaxies.</p>

<p>The last 100 years have brought a series of revolutions in astronomy, each one kicking Earth a bit farther from the center of things. Along the way, people have not exactly been receptive to these blows to our home planet’s centrality. In 1920, the question of whether there could be other “island universes” — galaxies — was the subject of the Great Debate between two astronomers. In the 1970s, when Mars was shown to have a pink sky, not blue, reporters booed. Their reaction “reflects our wish for Mars to be just like the Earth,” said astronomer Carl Sagan afterward. And in the 1990s, astronomers almost missed extrasolar planets hiding in their data because they had tailored their search techniques to find planets more like those in our own solar system.</p>



<p>But turning our focus from Earth has opened our minds to new possibilities, new universes, new places where life might exist. The next century of astronomy could bring better views of our cosmic origins and new strategies for finding worlds that other creatures call home.</p>



<p>The misperceptions of decades past suggest scientists should be careful when predicting just what we’ll find in the future.</p>



<p>“You learn a lot of humility in this business,” says planetary scientist Candice Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute, based in Tucson. “You always learn a lot more when you’re wrong than when you’re right.”</p>





More than the Milky Way



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, conventional wisdom held that the Milky Way stood alone. It contained stars, sometimes organized in clusters, and fuzzy patches of light known as nebulae. That was about it.</p>



<p>Some nebulae had spiral structures, “appearing in the telescope like vast Fourth-of-July pinwheels,” as Science News Letter, the predecessor of Science News, described them in 1924. In the 18th century, German philosopher Immanuel Kant had described nebulae as “higher universes,” or, “so to speak, Milky Ways.” But by the early 1900s, most astronomers thought that drawing that parallel was ridiculous.</p>



<p>“No competent thinker,” wrote historian of astronomy Agnes Clerke in 1890, can “maintain any single nebula to be a star system of coordinate rank with the Milky Way.”</p>



<p>By the 1920s, though, that view was already being challenged. As early as 1914, astronomer Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory in California argued that spiral nebulae are not part of the Milky Way, but rather “inconceivably distant galaxies of stars or separate stellar universes so remote that an entire galaxy becomes but an unresolved haze of light.”</p>



<p>Around the same time, Shapley, of Mount Wilson Observatory in California, began to prove that the Milky Way itself was inconceivably vast.</p>



<p>Shapley built on work by Henrietta Leavitt, one of a group of women “computers” at Harvard University who pored over photographic plates capturing the night sky. In studying photographs of the Magellanic Clouds, which we now know are two small galaxies that orbit the Milky Way, Leavitt noticed that certain stars varied in brightness over time, some of them in a peculiar way. “It is worthy of notice,” she wrote in 1908, that “the brighter variables have the longer periods.” In other words, brighter stars twinkled more slowly.</p>



♦In the early 1900s, astronomer Henrietta Leavitt discovered a feature of certain stars, called Cepheid variables, that helped other astronomers measure cosmic distances. Those stars ultimately helped prove that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.Photo by Margaret Harwood, courtesy of AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives, Physics Today Collection, Shapley Collection



<p>That meant that these variable stars, called Cepheids, could be used to estimate cosmic distances. It’s hard to tell how far away a cosmic object truly is — bright-looking stars could be intrinsically dim but close, while faint-looking stars could be intrinsically bright but distant. But all the Cepheids within the same cloud should be roughly the same distance from Earth. That meant “their periods are apparently associated with their actual emission of light,” Leavitt wrote in 1912. To figure out any Cepheid’s true brightness, all an astronomer had to do was measure its twinkling speed. It was a short step from there to figuring out its distance.</p>



<p>Shapley put this fact to use just a few years later, measuring distances to Cepheids within globular clusters of stars to figure out the sun’s position in the Milky Way. To his surprise, the sun was not in the center of the galaxy but off to one side. The Milky Way’s starry disk was also about 10 times wider than previous astronomers had assumed: about 300,000 light-years across, according to his calculations. (He overshot a bit; modern astronomers think it’s somewhere between 120,000 and 200,000 light-years.)</p>



<p>He and Curtis took their opposing views to the public at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., in April 1920, in an event that became known as the Great Debate. Each had 40 minutes to present their views on whether there is only one or several universes — what we now think of as galaxies.</p>



<p>Shapley, who was in his 30s and considered a rising star in the field, went first. A former journalist who reportedly was uncomfortable speaking to crowds, he read his argument from a typewritten script. He barely touched on the question of other universes, focusing instead on his new measurements of the Milky Way’s size. The implication was that the Milky Way was too large for other galaxies to make sense.</p>



<p>Curtis was an older, well-respected authority on spiral nebulae, as well as a gifted speaker. He argued for the then-standard view that the Milky Way was much smaller than Shapley supposed. But even a large Milky Way shouldn’t negate the possibility of other, equally large galaxies, he argued. The spectra of light coming from spiral nebulae was similar enough to that of the Milky Way that they could be similar objects, he maintained.</p>



<p>Both astronomers were partly right, and partly wrong.</p>



Galaxies come into view



<p>The Great Debate was resolved by a young astronomer named Edwin Hubble working at Mount Wilson. Hubble also used Leavitt’s Cepheid variable technique to measure cosmic distances, this time by finding the variable stars in the spiral nebulae themselves.</p>



<p>Hubble started observing the Andromeda nebula, one of the brightest nebulae on the sky, in the fall of 1923. He used Mount Wilson’s 60-inch telescope and its 100-inch telescope, then the world’s largest. Over the next year or so, he studied 35 Cepheids in Andromeda and a different nebula called Triangulum. Their periods were long enough that the nebulae had to be on the order of a million light-years away for the stars to appear so faint. (We now know it’s more like 2.5 million light-years to Andromeda and 2.7 million to Triangulum.)</p>



♦Astronomer Edwin Hubble, shown here holding a drawing of a galaxy, proved that there are other galaxies outside of the Milky Way.Hale Observatories, courtesy of AIP Emilio Segrè Visual Archives



<p>“Measuring the distance to Andromeda was a big deal because it was the first evidence that there are galaxies beyond our own,” says astronomer Emily Levesque of the University of Washington in Seattle. “It changed what we thought of as the shape of our universe.”</p>



<p>A few hints that the Milky Way was not alone had cropped up before that, but Hubble’s finding clinched it. Even if the Milky Way was as big as Shapley claimed, Andromeda lay outside its borders. When Shapley received Hubble’s paper, he reportedly said, “Here is the letter that destroyed my universe.”</p>



<p>Science News Letter reported Hubble’s finding under the headline “Sky Pinwheels Are Stellar Universes 6,000,000,000,000,000,000 Miles Away” in December 1924 (SN: 12/6/24, p. 2).</p>



<p>“It seems probable that many of the smaller spiral nebulae are still more remote and appear smaller on this account,” the story quotes Hubble as saying. “The portion of the universe within the range of our investigation consists of vast numbers of stellar galaxies comparable to our own, scattered about through nearly empty space and separated from one another by distances of inconceivable magnitude.” Here at last was the modern view of the universe.</p>



<p>By the end of the decade, Hubble had not only shown that the spiral nebulae were “island universes,” he also had begun to classify different galaxy types and think about how they evolved over time. What’s more, he showed that galaxies were flying away from each other at speeds proportional to their distance. In other words, the universe was expanding.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, astronomers knew that the universe was dotted with billions of galaxies of all shapes and sizes. In April 1990, NASA launched the first optical space telescope into Earth’s orbit, giving the world a new perspective on space.</p>



<p>“Instead of these blurry blobs from even the best mountaintop observatories on our planet,” says planetary scientist Jim Bell of Arizona State University in Tempe, “all of a sudden the entire realm of solar system, galaxy, extragalactic … was opened up by getting above the atmosphere.”</p>



<p>NASA named the telescope after the scientist who opened astronomers’ minds to the existence of such a universe: the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>The images it has captured over 30 years of operations — star clusters, galaxies and nebulae — are so iconic they are printed on everything from socks and coffee mugs to high fashion runway designs. The telescope itself was recently immortalized in Lego form.</p>



<p>“It’s the one that literally everyone has heard of,” says Levesque. Most people today think Hubble was “the guy who built the telescope.”</p>



<p>One image from early on in the space telescope’s tenure stands out. In December 1995, the telescope’s director, Robert Williams, decided to train the observatory on a tiny, dark patch of sky near the handle of the Big Dipper for 10 consecutive days. The resulting portrait of this featureless bit of sky revealed thousands of previously unknown galaxies sending their light from farther away than astronomers had ever seen before (SN: 1/20/96, p. 36). The universe as Edwin Hubble had imagined it, chock-full of island universes, was captured in one hard look.</p>



<p>As for Henrietta Leavitt, she missed out on the recognition she deserved for helping knock the Milky Way from its central perch. A Swedish mathematician wrote to her in 1925 saying that her work “has impressed me so deeply that I feel seriously inclined to nominate you to the Nobel Prize in physics for 1926.” He received a reply from Shapley, by then director of the Harvard College Observatory: Leavitt had died four years earlier.</p>




Bizarre beauties



<p>In the 1960s, astronomer Halton Arp proposed that researchers use the weirdest-looking galaxies as natural experiments to learn what gives a galaxy its shape. To help researchers figure out what makes a galaxy spiral, blobby or some other shape, Arp published the 1966 Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies, a compilation of 338 galaxies sorted by appearance.</p>



<p>Arp’s categories were spiral, elliptical, neither spiral nor elliptical, double and none of the above. At the time, some of the galaxies had no names or designations, and are still best known by their Arp numbers, like Arp 273 and Arp 147.</p>



<p>Despite their diversity, most of the peculiar galaxies are now thought to be going through a merger or interacting with another galaxy. But Arp never bought that explanation. He claimed for years that galaxies’ shapes come from material ejected from their luminous cores. Here are six of the most beautiful and bizarre galaxies, as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope and others, which offer much greater detail than Arp had access to half a century ago. — Lisa Grossman</p>

♦The blue ring galaxy on the right of this image of Arp 247 probably became ringshaped after the galaxy on the left passed through it. The collision created a density wave that propagated outward, like ripples through a pond. The pileup of gas produced by the wave helped spark the blue ring of star formation. The reddish knot at the bottom left of the ring may mark the galaxy’s original core.NASA, ESA, M. LIVIO/STSCI

♦NGC1569 is a dwarf galaxy in the constellation Camelopardalis that is undergoing a burst of star formation. Over the last 100 million years, it has formed stars at a rate 100 times that of the Milky Way. All that star formation eventually produced supernovas, whose strong stellar winds also sculpted the galaxy.NASA, ESA, THE HUBBLE HERITAGE TEAM/STSCI AND AURA





♦M51 is a classic spiral, with two curving arms of young blue stars reaching out from a yellowish central core of older stars. Some astronomers think the Whirlpool’s arms are so prominent because of the small galaxy at the tip of one of the arms, NGC5195 (yellow blob at right of image). Despite how close the galaxies look, NGC5195 has actually been passing behind the Whirlpool for hundreds of millions of years. Shock waves from the smaller galaxy’s passage may help sculpt the larger’s distinctive shape.NASA, ESA, S. BECKWITH/STSCI, THE HUBBLE HERITAGE TEAM/STSCI AND AURA






Steps to Mars



<p>The first liquid-fueled rockets, precursors to the ones that later carried robots and people into space, launched in the 1920s. A century later, robots have flown past, orbited or landed on every planetary body that was known in 1920, and a few that weren’t. People have walked on the moon and have lived in space for more than a year at a time. And serious talks about sending people to Mars are in the works.</p>



<p>NASA used to explore other worlds in a clear order, first observing with telescopes and then carrying out increasingly complex missions: flybys, orbiters, landers, rovers, then people and sample returns. “We’ve taken that entire progression on the moon, in [the last] century,” Bell says. “Sometime in this new century, we’ll add Mars to that list. All the rest of the solar system, we’ve got large chunks of that matrix checked off.”</p>



<p>After the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957, space launches came fast and furious. Many were demonstrations of political and military might. But a lot of them had scientific merit, too. The Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft photographed the farside of the moon in 1959 — shortly after NASA’s founding. Spacecraft flew past Venus and Mars in the 1960s, sending back the first closeup data on their alien atmospheres and surfaces.</p>



<p>That same decade, humans landed on the moon and brought back rocks, opening a wide and detailed window into the history of the solar system. The lunar samples from the Apollo missions gave scientists a way to figure out how old planetary surfaces are around the solar system, taught us that the entire inner solar system was bombarded with impacts in its youth and gave us an origin story for the moon (SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 18).</p>



<p>“Until we started the space program, we really had no idea what the geology was on other places,” says Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute. “Early in the century, they were still debating whether the craters on the moon were impact craters or volcanic calderas. Even right there in our own backyard, we didn’t know what was going on.”</p>



<p>And extraterrestrial geology was surprising. Without meaning to, planetary scientists had based a lot of their expectations for other worlds on the Earth. The cover of Science News from June 1976, the month before NASA’s Viking 1 lander became the first long-lived spacecraft to land softly on Mars, showed Mars with a Cheez Whiz–colored desert under a clear blue sky. In the sleep-deprived rush to release the first color images sent back by Viking 1, scientists processed the image to produce a blue sky there, too.</p>



♦Before NASA’s Viking 1 spacecraft landed on Mars in July 1976,&nbsp;Science News&nbsp;and others envisioned the Red Planet with a blue sky. Mars’ sky is actually a dusty yellowish-pink.



<p>But the day after the landing, James Pollack of the imaging team told reporters that the Martian sky was actually pink, probably thanks to scattered light from dust particles suspended in the air.</p>



<p>“When we found the sky of Mars to be a kind of pinkish-yellow rather than the blue which had erroneously first been reported, the announcement was greeted by a chorus of good-natured boos from the assembled reporters,” Sagan later wrote in the introduction to his popular book Cosmos. “They wanted Mars to be, even in this respect, like the Earth.”</p>



<p>Still, the Viking 1 and 2 landings brought Mars down to Earth, so to speak. “Mars had become a place,” Viking project scientist Gerald Soffen said in an interview for a NASA historical project published in 1984. “It went from a word, an abstract thought, to a real place.”</p>



<p>In some ways, the Viking landers’ views of Mars were disappointing. The mission’s central goal was explicitly to search for microbial life. It was “a long shot,” journalist Janet L. Hopson wrote in Science News in June 1976 (SN: 6/5/76, p. 374). But “even if no signs of life appear, [biologists] stand to gain their first real perspective on terrestrial biochemistry, life origins and evolution.”</p>



<p>The results of the Viking mission’s life-detection experiments were inconclusive, a finding almost worse than a true negative.</p>



<p>NASA subsequently pulled back from seeking life directly. The next 45 years of Mars missions searched for signs of past water, potentially habitable environments and organic molecules, instead of living organisms. All of those features turned up in data from the Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rovers in the 2000s and 2010s.</p>



<p>Now, NASA’s Perseverance rover, which landed in February 2021, is hunting for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will cache rock samples that a future mission will bring back to Earth. And the joint Russian and European space agencies’ ExoMars rover — named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist whose work was central to discovering DNA’s structure — aims to seek molecular signatures of life on Mars and just below the surface after it launches in 2022.</p>



<p>Sagan predicted in 1973 that if he had been born 50 years in the future, the search for life on Mars would have already been completed. Today, 48 years later, we’re still looking.</p>

Exotic moons



<p>The year after the Vikings landed on Mars, another pair of spacecraft launched to check almost the entire rest of the solar system off scientists’ must-see list. Astronomers realized that in 1977, the planets would line up in such a way that a spacecraft launched that year could reach Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune one by one, stealing a little angular momentum from each world as it went along. The mission was dubbed Voyager (SN: 8/27/77, p. 132).</p>



<p>“There’s never been anything like it, and there never will be again,” says Bell, of Arizona State. “It was comparable to the voyages of Magellan or Darwin or Lewis and Clark. Just an absolutely profound mission of discovery that completely changed the landscape of planetary science in this century.”</p>



<p>Voyager’s views of the outer solar system forced scientists to think outside of the “Earth box,” says Hansen, who worked on the mission. “The Voyager imaging team, bless their hearts, they would make predictions and then they’d be wrong,” she says. “And we would learn something.”</p>



<p>Hansen recalls chatting with a member of the imaging team when the spacecraft was approaching Jupiter and its dozens of moons. “He said, ‘Candy, we will see craters on [moons] Io and Europa, because we know from the density that those are rocky worlds. But not on Ganymede and Callisto, because those are ice,’ ” she recalls. Instead, the images showed Ganymede and Callisto were covered in craters. “That was an aha moment — ice is going to act like rock at those temperatures.” Meanwhile, ocean-swathed Europa and molten Io had almost no craters.</p>



<p>The moons of Jupiter presented “a whole, previously unimagined family of exotic worlds, each radically different not only from its companions, but also from everything else in the planet-watcher’s experience,” journalist Jonathan Eberhart wrote in Science News in April 1980 (SN: 4/19/80, p. 251).</p>



<p>Before 1979, Earth was the only geologically active, rocky world scientists knew about. But Voyager changed that view, too. A member of Voyager’s optical navigation team, Linda Morabito, spotted an odd, mushroom-shaped feature extending off the edge of Io while she was trying to plot the spacecraft’s position on March 9, 1979. She consulted with the science team, and they soon realized they were looking at a gigantic volcanic plume. Io was erupting in real time.</p>



<p>Three planetary scientists had predicted Io’s fire before the plumes were discovered. The three suggested the moon was heated by a gravitational tug-of-war between Jupiter and one or two of its other moons, Europa and Ganymede.</p>



<p>But most of the planetary science community was stunned. “We take gravity for granted here. It keeps our feet on the ground,” Hansen says. “But gravity molds and shapes so many things in so many unexpected ways.”</p>



<p>Voyager and subsequent missions to the outer planets, like Galileo at Jupiter in the 1990s and Cassini at Saturn in the 2000s, transformed our view of the solar system in another profound way. They revealed several surprising parts of the solar system where life might exist today.</p>



<p>Voyager hinted that Europa might have a liquid water ocean beneath an icy shell. Galileo strengthened that idea, and suggested the ocean might be salty and have contact with the moon’s rocky core, which could provide chemical nutrients for microbial life. NASA is now developing a mission to fly past Europa. “I will not be surprised if life is somehow discovered on Europa in my lifetime, or in this century,” Bell says.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004, scientists realized that the tiny moon Enceladus vents dramatic plumes of water vapor, dust and ice crystals into space from a hidden subsurface sea. That moon also looks like a good place for life.</p>



<p>If the last century of exploring the solar system was about coming to grips with alien geology, Hansen says, this coming century is going to be about oceanography — getting a grip on the strange seas in our own solar system.</p>



<p>“I think that’s going to shape a lot of the research going forward,” Hansen says. Now that it’s clear these moons have oceans, researchers will ask if they are habitable, and eventually, if they are inhabited.</p>



Exoplanets detected



<p>The first planet spotted outside our solar system — an exoplanet — was so different from anything in our solar system that astronomers weren’t hunting for anything like it.</p>



<p>“Knowing that there are actually planets around other stars now seems so trivial to say,” says exoplanet observer Debra Fischer of Yale University. “But we had arguments in 1995 about whether other stars have planets.”</p>



<p>So when astronomer Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory turned his spectrograph on the sky in April 1994, he kept quiet about his hopes of finding true exoplanets. He was more likely to find brown dwarfs, failed stars that never grew massive enough to burn hydrogen.</p>



<p>His instrument used a clever new way to hunt for other worlds, called the radial velocity technique. Previous exoplanet hunters had looked directly for a star’s motion in response to the gravity of an orbiting planet, watching to see if the star would move back and forth in the sky. That technique had led to several planetary claims, even dating back to 1855, but none of them had held up. Those motions are tiny; Jupiter’s influence moves the sun by just 12 meters per second.</p>




Exoplanet detections



<p>Astronomers have hunted exoplanets with several techniques, some better than others. The earliest claimed exoplanet detections used the astrometry method, but almost none of them held up. Success came with the radial velocity method in the 1990s. But the transit method has proved most prolific. </p>

<p>Instead, Mayor and others studied a shift in the wavelength of starlight as a star moved to and fro. As a star approaches us, the light shifts to shorter, or bluer, wavelengths; as it moves away, the light grows redder. Calculating the velocity of a star’s back-and-forth motion, astronomers could figure out the minimum mass and length of the year of whatever was tugging that star.</p>



<p>The shifts Mayor was looking for were still minuscule. The search was considered futile, and fringe — like looking for little green men. So astronomers who explicitly claimed to be searching for planets had a hard time scheduling observations at telescopes. Brown dwarfs, on the other hand, were considered legitimate science, and would be easier to detect.</p>



<p>So the world was astounded when, in October 1995, Mayor and his student Didier Queloz reported strong evidence not of a brown dwarf, but of a true planet orbiting the sunlike star 51 Pegasi, about 50 light-years from our solar system.</p>



<p>The new planet was weird. It seemed to be about half the mass of Jupiter, too puny to be a brown dwarf. But it orbited the star once every 4.23 Earth days, putting it incredibly close to its star. There’s nothing like that in our solar system, and astronomers had no idea how it could exist.</p>



<p>“The news flashed through the astronomical community like a lightning bolt,” wrote journalist Ron Cowen in Science News, in the first of three stories on the new planet he would write within a month (SN: 10/21/95, p. 260).</p>



<p>51 Peg b, as it came to be known, launched a new era. “It means planets exist around other sunlike stars, we can find them, and they might be the exciting ones,” says Yale anthropologist Lisa Messeri, who has studied how astronomers create worlds out of pixels and spectra. “Firsts are exciting because they promise there will be seconds and thirds and fourths.”</p>




Big surprise&nbsp;



<p>The first planet found orbiting a star similar to our sun fit nobody’s mold. Dubbed a “hot Jupiter,” 51 Pegasi b is bigger than Jupiter, but 20 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun (Earth is one astronomical unit, AU, or 150 million kilometers from the sun). 51 Pegasi b circles its star in four days; Earth’s orbit is a lengthier 365 days.</p>



A tight orbit for a large planet



♦C. Chang

<p>The search was on. A group from San Francisco quickly found two more planets hiding in data the researchers hadn’t finished analyzing yet. Those next two planets, 70 Vir b and 47 UMa b, were also more massive and closer to their stars than expected.</p>



<p>The existence of these three worlds, which were named hot Jupiters because their close-in orbits should make them sizzle, upended the paradigm for what a planet could be like. Clearly, our solar system was not the template for the universe.</p>



<p>Yet for a few years after 51 Peg b was announced, astronomers debated whether the planet was really there. Maybe the star’s apparent back-and-forth was just its outer atmosphere breathing in and out. Those debates waned as more planets were discovered, but it took a new technique to really convince everyone.</p>



<p>Astronomers had predicted at least back to the 1850s that some planets would pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. As it crossed, or transited, the face of its star, a planet could reveal its presence by blocking a little bit of the star’s light.</p>



<p>But if other solar systems are like ours, transits would be incredibly difficult to detect. Our planets are too small and too far from the sun to cast a large shadow. Hot Jupiters, on the other hand, should block way more of a star’s light than any planets in our solar system. With the discovery of 51 Peg b, transits seemed not only possible to detect, but almost easy.</p>



<p>The first transiting extrasolar planet revealed itself in 1999, when then-Harvard graduate student David Charbonneau drove to Colorado to do his thesis work with astronomer Tim Brown. Brown had built a tiny telescope on a friend’s farm north of Boulder, setting up the computers in a repurposed turkey coop, to search for transiting planets. By the time Charbonneau arrived, however, the farm had been sold and the telescope relocated to a lab site.</p>



<p>To practice the technique, Charbonneau aimed Brown’s telescope at a star, called HD 209458, that already had a suspected planet. The star’s light dimmed by about 1 percent, and then it shone bright again. That was a clear sign of a planet about 32 percent wider than Jupiter.</p>



<p>That discovery ended all doubts about the existence of exoplanets, says Fischer, who had worked with the exoplanet-hunting group in San Francisco. “It happened like that,” Fischer says, with a finger snap. The combined size and mass of the planet unambiguously ruled out brown dwarfs or other exotic explanations. “It walks like a Jupiter, talks like a Jupiter, it’s a Jupiter.”</p>



<p>There was another advantage to the transit method: It can show the composition of a planet’s atmosphere. Planets detected by the wobble technique were “little more than phantoms,” Cowen wrote in Science News in 2007. They were too small to be seen, and too close to the star to be photographed directly.</p>



<p>“Everyone had assumed that if you wanted to [detect] the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet, you’d have to image it,” Charbonneau told Science News. But starlight filtering through a transiting planet’s sky could reveal what gases surround the alien world without the need for a snapshot.</p>



Hunt for habitable planets



<p>Transits soon overtook wobbles as the most fruitful planet-finding strategy. That was mostly thanks to the launch of NASA’s Kepler space telescope in March 2009.</p>



<p>Kepler’s mission was explicitly about finding other Earths. For nearly four years, the telescope stared at 170,000 stars in a single patch of sky to catch as many transiting planets as it could. In particular, its operators were hoping for Earth-sized planets in Earthlike orbits around sunlike stars — places where life could conceivably exist.</p>



<p>The years that followed were a boom time for planet finders. By the end of its nearly 10-year run, Kepler had confirmed almost 2,700 planets and thousands more potential planets. Findings went beyond the hot Jupiters to worlds the size of Earth and planets in the “habitable zone,” where temperatures could be right for liquid water.</p>



<p>Discoveries came so quickly that a single new world stopped being a news story. Kepler’s data shifted from revealing new worlds one by one to taking an exoplanet census. It showed that hot Jupiters are not actually the most common type of planet; they were just the easiest ones to spot. The most common type makes no appearance in our solar system: worlds between the size of Earth and Neptune, which may be rocky super-Earths or gaseous mini-Neptunes.</p>



<p>And Kepler revealed that there are more planets in the galaxy than stars. Every one of the billions and billions of stars in the Milky Way should have at least one world in its orbit.</p>



<p>But the telescope never really achieved the goal of finding another Earth. Kepler required three transits to confirm a world’s existence. That means the telescope had to stare for at least three years to find a planet orbiting at Earth’s exact distance.</p>



<p>By 2013, after four years of observing, half of Kepler’s stabilizing reaction wheels had failed. The telescope couldn’t maintain its unblinking view of the same part of the sky. Mission scientists cleverly reprogrammed the telescope to look at other stars for shorter spans of time. But most of the planets found there orbited closer to their stars than Earth does, meaning they couldn’t be Earth twins.</p>



<p>Finally, Kepler ran out of fuel in 2018, with no true Earth analog in sight.</p>



<p>Messeri recalls an exoplanet conference at MIT in 2011 where a lot of the conversation was about finding a twin of Earth.</p>



<p>“It was a peak of excitement — maybe we’re going to find this planet in the next three years, or five years. It felt close,” she says. “What’s interesting is, in the 10 years since then, it still feels that close.”</p>



<p>But astronomers had already realized they might not need a true Earth analog to find a planet where life could exist. Rocky worlds orbiting smaller, dimmer stars than the sun are easier to find, and might be just as friendly to life.</p>



<p>Charbonneau again was ahead of the curve, having started a program called MEarth in 2008 to hunt for habitable planets around puny M dwarf stars using eight small telescopes in Arizona (plus another eight in Chile that were added in 2014). Within six months, Charbonneau and colleagues had found a super-Earth dubbed GJ 1214b that is probably a water world — maybe a bit too wet for life.</p>



<p>The European Southern Observatory started the TRAPPIST, for TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope, survey from La Silla, Chile, in 2010. Another telescope, at Oukaïmeden Observatory in Morocco, came online to search for planets orbiting Northern Hemisphere stars in 2016. Among that survey’s discoveries is the TRAPPIST-1 system of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a single M dwarf star, three of which might be in the habitable zone (SN: 3/18/17, p. 6).</p>



♦The star TRAPPIST-1 hosts seven planets (shown in an artist’s illustration) that all probably have a rocky composition. At least three of the planets could have temperatures that are good for life.JPL-Caltech/NASA



<p>NASA’s successor to Kepler, TESS, or Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, has been scanning the entire sky since April 2018 for small planets orbiting bright nearby stars, including M dwarfs. It spotted more than 2,200 potential planets in its first full-sky scan, scientists announced in March 2021.</p>



<p>These days, astronomers are joining up with scientists across disciplines, from planetary scientists who study hypothetical exoplanet geology to microbiologists and chemists who think about what kinds of aliens could live on those planets and how to detect those life-forms. That’s a big shift from even 10 years ago, Messeri says. In the early 2010s, no one was talking about life.</p>



<p>“You weren’t allowed to say that,” she says. “Astronomers would whisper it to me during fieldwork, but this was not a search for aliens.”</p>



<p>Exoplanet astronomy is on firmer ground now. Its leading figures have won MacArthur “genius” grants. Pioneer planet finders Mayor and Queloz won the 2019 Nobel Prize in physics. The work is no longer hidden away in conferences that are actually about stars. “It doesn’t have to legitimize itself anymore,” Messeri says. “It’s a real science.”</p>



<p>The promise that transiting planets can reveal the contents of their alien atmospheres may soon be fulfilled. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope may launch this year, after many years of delays. One of its first tasks will be to probe the atmospheres of transiting planets, including those of TRAPPIST-1.</p>



<p>If anything is alive on those absolutely alien, unearthly worlds, maybe the next century will bring it to light.</p>

  A 93-year-old Xerces blue specimen’s DNA shows that the butterfly is a distinct species, making it the first U.S. insect humans drove to extinction.

  <p>It’s been roughly 80 years since the Xerces blue butterfly was last spotted flitting about on pastel wings across coastal California sand dunes. But scientists are still learning about the insect.</p>



<p>New research on DNA from a nearly century-old museum specimen shows that the butterfly was a distinct species. What’s more, that finding means that the Xerces blue butterfly (Glaucopsyche xerces) is the first U.S. insect species known to go extinct because of humans, researchers report July 21 in Biology Letters. </p>



<p>The butterfly used to live only on the San Francisco Peninsula. But by the early 1940s, less than a century after its formal scientific description in the 1850s, the gossamer-winged butterfly had vanished. Its rapid disappearance is attributed to the loss of habitat and native plant food as a result of urban development and, possibly, an influx of invasive ants likely spread though the shipment of goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s long been unclear if the Xerces blue butterfly was its own species, or simply an isolated population of another, more widespread species of blue butterfly, says Corrie Moreau, an entomologist at Cornell University.</p>



<p>To find out, Moreau and colleagues turned to a 93-year-old Xerces specimen housed at Chicago’s Field Museum, extracting DNA from a tiny bit of the insect’s tissue. Despite the DNA being degraded from age, the team could compare selected Xerces genes with those of other closely related blue butterflies. The researchers also compared the genomes, or genetic instruction books, of the insects’ mitochondria — cellular structures involved in energy production that have their own set of DNA.&nbsp;</p>



♦Scientists analyzed DNA from a specimen in the collection of Xerces blue butterflies (shown) at Chicago’s Field Museum to reveal that the extinct insect was a distinct species.  Field Museum



<p>Using the genes and the “mitogenomes,” the researchers crafted an evolutionary tree, showing how all of the butterfly species are related to each other. The extinct Xerces blue butterfly was genetically distinct, thus warranting classification as a species, the team found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We sort of lost a piece of the biodiversity puzzle that made up the tapestry of the San Francisco Bay area when this species was driven to extinction,” Moreau says.</p>





<p>Akito Kawahara, a lepidopterist at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville not involved with the study, thinks the results are “fairly convincing” that the Xerces blue butterfly was its own species.</p>



<p>The butterfly is considered a candidate for resurrection, Moreau says, where extinct species are brought back via cloning or other genetic manipulations (SN: 10/20/17). But she cautions against it. “Maybe we should spend that time and energy and money on ensuring that we protect the blues that are already endangered that we know about,” she says.</p>





<p>One of these insects is the endangered El Segundo blue (Euphilotes battoides allyni), native to the Los Angeles area. It and other butterfly populations are increasingly imperiled by numerous threats, such as climate change, land-use changes and pesticide use (SN: 8/17/16).</p>



<p>For Felix Grewe, an evolutionary biologist at the Field Museum, the new finding illustrates why long-term museum collections are so important: Specimens’ true utility may not be clear for many years. After all, the genetic techniques used in the study to illuminate the Xerces blue butterfly’s true identity didn’t exist when the insect went extinct.</p>



<p>“You don&#8217;t know what technology there [will be] 100 years from now,” Grewe says.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that psychology students are more likely to be women than men, and that women outnumber men in the clinical psychology workforce, women in psychology publish less, receive fewer citations, and are underrepresented at senior positions within university departments. This juxtaposition of over and underrepresentation poses an interesting question about how people perceive gender roles within the field.</p>



<p>It’s this question Guy A. Boysen and team explore in a new study, published in the Journal of Social Psychology. They find that people associate psychology more strongly with femininity than masculinity — and that this may affect how men and women feel about working or studying within the field.</p>







<p>In the first study, participants filling in surveys online were asked what percentage of students studying psychology at university level were women, and what percentage of psychologists were women. The results showed that people see psychology as a more women-heavy profession and discipline, with participants estimating that 62% of psychology students and 59% of psychologists are women.</p>



<p>A second study looked more directly at people’s perceptions of how “feminine” or “masculine” psychology is as a field. Both online participants and undergraduate students rated various university degrees and careers on a scale from “extremely feminine” to “extremely masculine”. The breadth of majors and careers listed were included due to their association with particular gendered stereotypes — engineering, for example, is stereotypically assumed to be a masculine job while nursing is thought to be feminine.</p>



<p>A psychology major was considered by both groups to be slightly more feminine than masculine, and was rated as significantly more feminine than typically &#8220;masculine&#8221; subjects like engineering, business, and maths (though majors like nursing and education were considered more feminine than psychology). Similarly, while a career in psychology was seen as less feminine than teaching or nursing, it was considered significantly more feminine than being a neuroscientist, historian, doctor, or business person.</p>



<p>In the next study, participants were asked to imagine a stereotypical person in one of three subjects at university: engineering, nursing, or psychology. After being shown stereotypically masculine and feminine traits — for example &#8220;gentle&#8221; for feminine or &#8220;egotistical&#8221; for masculine — participants rated how well each word described a person studying the subject they had been assigned.</p>



<p>As expected, participants tended to believe that both positive and negative masculine traits better described engineering students than psychology students, while positive feminine traits better described psychology students than engineers. The only difference between nursing and psychology was in positive masculine traits: these were believed to better suit nursing majors than psychology students. This suggests that psychology, like nursing, is largely considered to be a “feminine” subject.</p>



<p>In a fourth study, participants indicated how satisfied they believed men and women would be with a career in psychology. Participants who read that psychology students were 75% women and 25% men rated men’s satisfaction as significantly lower than women’s. But those who read there was an equal percentage of women and men didn’t show any difference in ratings of men’s and women’s satisfaction. A similar follow-up part of the study also found that men were seen as less likely to have their needs met by a career in psychology than women.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggested that psychology is considered to be significantly more feminine than it is masculine, and that people assume men’s needs may therefore not be met by it as a subject of study or a career. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But is this actually true? Future research could look at how men and women in psychology feel themselves — just because a field is perceived to be &#8220;feminine&#8221; doesn’t mean that men will necessarily be less satisfied or fulfilled when working within it. Whether men are actually put off careers in psychology is a different question that could be explored in more depth.</p>



<p>It’s also important to go back to the fact of the overrepresentation of men in certain positions. If psychology is seen as a &#8220;feminine&#8221; occupation, and if women outnumber men, why do men dominate positions of power? Looking at ways for everyone to succeed and feel comfortable in psychology is crucial.</p>



<p>&#8211; Evidence for a gender stereotype about psychology and its effect on perceptions of men’s and women’s fit in the field</p>
